2:36
the energy inside
2:41
what up cheers everybody all right welcome welcome tonight I uh I
2:49
don't know much of what happened today except that GameStop seemed to pop shortly after that video would take a
2:56
lot right I'm like 99 kitten but um I did notice I actually don't even know
3:01
how it ended up though let's let's check on it oh typed it in wrong
3:08
what did am I typing that around what am I doing
3:15
that's weird that's not working let me tell that one more time because I didn't just see you
3:20
said Germany oh that's weird huh you never see that
3:26
that's bizarre
3:32
oh what the hell oh that is weird that is weird
3:40
commercials one final time this is it if I click this and that don't work what are you gonna do
3:48
all right anyway all right let's check stock charts um
3:53
what the hell oh
3:59
okay all right the the company didn't just suddenly stop you know like trading you know what
4:04
that would have been somewhat surprising but uh I don't know if you got to see but I uploaded that new um the new
4:10
GameStop video it took me it took me an extra night I thought I was gonna be able to finish it but um
4:15
and uh yeah it just so happened that I just got it done and uh just before the uh
4:21
um the trading week ended and I hope you like it but I'd be curious if you have any feedback on the style of the um of
4:26
the the video I just thought I'd try something new with it took me a while as I said it took me a while to uh
4:32
to get the uh to learn final cut I was used in iMovie when I just uh got things going again a couple months ago and I
4:39
thought I'd take the time to learn final cut and then just try out some new graphics and stuff but um yeah let me know what you think if you like that
4:44
style of providing research and stuff obviously the thesis is much more robust than the video the video shows that's
4:51
like how much I mean it covers the gist of it you know what that's how I feel and uh for people who are somewhat tied uh dialed into the
4:58
story that that covers most of it but if not let me know and uh because I feel like most people aren't going to watch 20 minutes or 60 Minutes video I that's
5:05
like how long those other ones were but um yeah let me know if if you like it
5:10
and who's around on a Friday you know what I mean but I thought ah just well I don't care I just upload it see if
5:15
people think and um yeah we'll see but anyway sure just so had coincidence right I know it's coincidence shortly
5:21
after I uh took it public and then the stock stock price shot and traded off right so we're okay can we can we
5:27
attribute it to Roy Kitty for fun for the hell of it you know what I mean um but yeah sure it just happened just
5:33
so happened right coincidence like I said shortly after I took it public um it rang it was up like 20 today at
5:39
one point huh but um anyway no news I didn't see anything I saw like Buckle reported something and then just just a
5:45
little bit of acquisitive so we'll see what happens from here but I expect it's gonna be a uh it's gonna be a busy quarter on the news
5:51
front you know what I mean we have earnings it's going to be reported in three or four weeks from now and um but
5:57
could they report maybe they'll report something sooner than that I really I'm not really not sure
6:02
um uh we know the sale B cell lease back seems like it may have already taken place but they could wait to learnings I
6:07
have no idea um but regardless regardless it could be um um a relatively weak Q2 but maybe
6:15
it's already priced in but Hereafter after that what else is left I feel like it's only really bullish news following
6:21
that we'll see though I mean I've been wrong I've been around so many times but uh and anyway I got the chart pulled up
6:27
here but um doesn't it seem bullish I decided to include that in this video uh the latest video I forget if I included
6:33
honestly I forget if I included the other one um but it seems like a bullish shark to me but what the hell do I know I have no
6:39
idea and um but yeah this is bullish this whole turnaround right here so you
6:45
you layer this on to some bullish fundamental new fundamental events unfolding who the hell knows so we'll
6:50
see what happens but um it's a five year all right yeah this
6:56
looks good nowhere close to being overbought on the weekly right isn't that kind of it's not that's not that's not bullish per se but if it starts to
7:02
pick up it starts getting bullish then you could expect it to take off maybe people disagree maybe technical analysts
7:08
um disagree with my take on that check which wouldn't surprise me because uh I don't know it's just my takes time so
7:13
everything's subjective right value subjective for the most part charts are somewhat suggested because it depends on
7:19
your time Horizon and all that stuff and there's a lot that goes into it but anyway uh this isn't uh this isn't a
7:24
GameStop stream this is a an investing stream so um anyway I I but I saw
7:29
GameStop was up 20 at some point that's a con it's you know what let me just dial in here is this a important move
7:36
a little bit oh look at that so what was that June 10th where did it close
7:42
they closed just about five oh they closed about five it's the first close above five in a month all right that's somewhat meaningful right huh we can uh
7:49
if we want it to be I guess but um oh yeah and then what did it get to 560.
7:57
holy hell all right let's see what happens meaningless without news it's all the
8:03
fundamental events they don't drive everything that's my take anyway unless unless it starts breaking out then I feel like the technical analyst pylon
8:08
blah blah blah blah blah but um all right close about five all right we'll take that anyway I actually don't even
8:14
know what the hell else happened today let's take a peek um oh I do know a little bit though because I owe Lumber look at this so
8:21
mostly a quiet day in fact oh you know what I noticed today I did see one thing I saw that the market the
8:28
broad Market was up oh look at this the Dow was up more than the NASDAQ but I noticed that small caps were down
8:34
was it just the wrong Kitty no but I feel like I did check up on
8:40
something uh excuse me iwm
8:46
what's going on oh so is it just yeah did they change oh did they you know what did they change um
8:56
must just be Yahoo down huh that's bizarre uh Apple I mean if this if the search results pop
9:03
up and it doesn't show up that's then you what the hell all right so they have a new do they have a new uh URL
9:10
I didn't think so let me see that looks the same to me what about this what
9:20
all right I tried
9:25
try this one more time all right whatever we don't we don't get a force that we don't have to force it
9:31
we have other methods besides Yahoo finance you know that's just what I've programmed into the uh yeah so I noticed
9:37
it was down a little bit today but everything else seemed up that was kind of interesting why did I check oh you know why I looked it up because
9:42
I noticed um I just noticed the Roaring Kitty portfolio was down and then I just quickly pulled up
9:48
just this and I saw oh this is all green and this is red you know what that's you
9:54
don't see that too often and this this is the Russell 2000 just
10:00
to be oh you can see this yeah this is just the Russell 2000 right but down a percent when everything else is green
10:06
you don't see that too often anyway I just caught my attention um
10:11
so was natural gas up today all right so anyway uh that was what happens in broadly I don't need to check everything
10:17
else natural gas was this really yeah yeah it got whoa I didn't see this is
10:23
that today what's the date 21st holy I missed this I could have sworn
10:29
did it happen late in the day
10:35
wait a second this says 244
10:42
but you're telling me you're telling me close at 2 57 what is
10:48
there Futures what's going on here
10:54
I don't know I mean that's kind of a big is a temp is that a not quite a 10 difference but
11:02
what to believe I guess I'll believe investing.com right
11:08
not a big deal anyway um so any uh but I so I did notice any
11:14
particular so in on the line of I mean natural gas I feel like I'm looking at natural gas every damn stream for better or worse I don't know but I
11:21
saw RC pulling back right and so um not a big pullback or anything like that but when our seats pulling back and that's
11:27
such a bullish chart and it's kind of tied to values and commodities and so forth I think if rrc is pulling back then that's kind of telling of what the
11:34
war on Kitty portfolio is going to be doing right um and so it's funny I didn't think that
11:40
when I had nothing to do with the position but now it's like been such a strong
11:45
um Trend and everything like that and fundamentally and so forth that like it caught my attention so they want to pull back I'm like oh if this is pulling back
11:51
probably everything is pulling back and lo and behold it was but I mean not a big pullback right meaningless but I
11:56
used it as an opportunity to add to do you notice AR was up today I mean small it's just a small
12:03
percentage right but um um yeah I'm like all right yeah so it turned out to be great timing on that ad
12:10
I'll come back to the dash just what time is it 7 13. look at me checking up on the clock already
12:17
um I mean yeah we I just added to AR earlier this week right and it's been holding up pretty damn well I mean kind
12:22
of the royal Kitty portfolio is pulled back a tad not really not much I it's embarrassing that I'd even say that
12:27
because it's so small that but I just noticed sometimes when it pulls back a little bit but AR flat flat since that
12:33
uh since it pulled back which is not that meaningful but a little bit meaningful right and so I added that day
12:39
and it's like holding up relative to rrc and relative I didn't check everything else today oh SW almost up a little bit today okay
12:46
after a pullback though right you know what I mean eqt yeah I mean everything's flattened there's nothing really to discern here
12:52
but um I thought all right good job AR hold it up maybe that's going to be a good ad we'll see but um
12:59
um and then what about SD I think I so I I yeah I use I I think I added to SD today
13:05
too is it reflected here I can't remember I think I updated it I added a little bit of SD too I've been
13:11
waiting for a little bit of a pullback you know what I mean just a little bit it's still what is it is it top ten uh top 15 that's not that's something
13:18
but um let's hope it pulls back a little bit more you know what I mean I'd add a little bit more to this oh and you know what I did I trimmed our RC you may see
13:24
I trimmed our RC so I finally did it turned out I was a little bit delayed you know what I mean
13:29
um I should have done it that day yeah that's what you get I should have trimmed rrc that day I bought more AR and I just just have mistakenly was like
13:38
yeah let's just wait a day yeah whatever it's okay so I trimmed it was like five or eight I don't even know what it was
13:43
down since then but in um so I trimmed and then I um I didn't add to AR but I added to Sandridge and so we'll see I'll
13:50
take the pullback you know what I mean RC that's fine take take it on that and uh because Sanders has much more upside
13:55
so I'll take that I only added a little bit because I feel like this thing these are speculative stocks you got to give
14:01
them time you know what I mean this isn't like a huge pullback or anything like that um but it's a pullback it was right here
14:07
dollar rate it was down 10 10 more than that but that's not that big of a pullback
14:12
for these stocks and 50 is a pullback for these types of stocks make no mistake jeez um but that's why it's still I just just
14:19
spotted my time there's no rush on any of this um no rush at all really
14:24
we got we could have weeks or months to this so just just bought my time uh but
14:29
really I don't think I did anything else but no yeah anyway so it stuck out to be today because GameStop was up nine
14:35
percent everything else was like kind of down for the most part so a lot of the um what oh what was oil
14:42
doing today does this work oh I did I program the oil it's 42 it's been 42.
14:47
it's been four how long has it been 42. it's been 42 forever ah
14:54
cheers oil huh I know the the charts all messed up
14:59
right because of how low a drop but even if we do like can we do like uh just like a month or something let's do one month it's like it's doing nothing huh
15:08
no it's 40 bucks 40 to 42 that's crazy has it been this stable for a month what's the one month um standard
15:14
deviation going back 10 years I have no idea but uh that seems super stable even
15:20
I don't know I wouldn't make that claim no way but um anyway it looks like energy
15:26
pulled back maybe there was news today what would be a good one ExxonMobil
15:34
Chevron gets regular okay to shut anything today yeah
15:42
that there was anything P10 that's a drill oh yeah that was a nice draw we talked about HP and PDS I thought P10
15:47
was a pretty a pretty solid driller I should have mentioned that I forgot I mean it's one of the top positions I kind of forgot
15:54
but like balance sheet wise and just how it was historically run boy it really hasn't done much though
16:00
that's a bummer damn oh that's a bad couple uh couple days too it didn't do much it didn't
16:07
bounce back as strongly as I would have hoped as some of these other ones interesting sometimes the balance Sheet's so strong
16:12
for some of these they don't bounce as strong as you'd like you know what I mean some of the the more speculative ones the risky ones they kind of come
16:18
roaring back and this one didn't I mean I bought in low my average cost is definitely around two
16:26
to three and then I was like it didn't even barely doubled damn so drilling huh and what about what all what is HP and
16:32
PDS doing oh that's how much in pain that
16:38
could be a leader hmm what do you think
16:46
how about the more speculative ones PDS holding up what the hell how about BT so like oil sands and uh BT
16:53
pulling back oh I mean it's just it's a small percentage right now hey this is an opportunity to add you know what I mean
17:00
I do I don't have a quick way to I just kind of got to do this
17:07
oh I mean it's it's position size over 100 you know what I mean so that's why yeah that's like it's like oh you can
17:13
almost rest assured that as soon as I start dabbling a little bit it's going to pull back so like I've kind of learned that's why that's why the
17:18
smallest position the smallest non-nominal position I need to do I need to work it is cndt that was the one that
17:25
Carl was playing yeah let's just get a startup position and uh and I think I feel like it's down 10 or 20 or
17:30
something but it's so small this one this is there's other ways to manage risk and you can at least start dabbling
17:35
it it forces you to yeah I felt like I bought in right around here and now you
17:40
don't now you see why it was the reason it's this it's literally the smallest position in the portfolio because let's just see what happens anyway this seems
17:47
like it could be a good place to add back um I'll tell you what if Carl started adding
17:54
after this pop oh that's a different Clifford I thought that was going to be Clifford so soon I
18:00
thought that was Clifford oh wait a second wait a second all right not this
18:05
time different cliff when's the last time you added what the hell is that
18:12
um oh he had it on August what is this
18:19
he added August 14th at six dollars huh we looking at the
18:25
right chart
18:33
what what is this
18:43
what's going on am I I feel like am I am I taking crazy pills what's in this would you put what'd you put in this
18:57
oh 2019 oh my God oh my God
19:02
what am I doing ah geez okay so he hasn't bought since May oh I did you know I just jumped ahead to the dark
19:07
green so what open Insider does is it it highlights the um the bigger purchases dark green and I mistakenly just jumped
19:14
to the dark range just thinking those are the ones who I could I thought he had just purchased quite a bit recently but uh apparently not
19:21
um so in that case it's just one to keep an eye on you know what I mean that's that's why it's so small you know if he was if he was going in heavy
19:27
especially recently with the price discounted then it's like all right then we can make it a little bit more but if he's just in it and not actively trading
19:33
it and then it's a little bit of like all right let's just see maybe if I dive in deeper I'll reassess
19:39
um I mean right now I just pulled up I forgot but certainly when I took the position 2019 and in 2020 he hasn't even he
19:46
hasn't I mean there's plenty of other opportunities but it says about cndt let's keep let's keep
19:52
checking in things um yeah so things were kind of down today water wttr CVG oh CVI done back 10
20:00
oh it's not quite where I want I want a little bit more you know what I mean I talked about it pulling back I want to
20:05
put yeah at least below four there's nothing to do with it right now I maybe I should have been taking gains I
20:12
don't know but um maybe isn't that how big is it
20:17
it's not even a percent you know what I mean I just let it let it ride I don't care
20:23
if I guess um am I doing for cat oh I didn't update cash but it should be it should be about
20:29
balanced okay
20:37
we're just gonna see everything down a little bit today not much
20:43
I feel oh okay this pulled back below 10. this is a tough one everything's kind of pulling back here this is something to keep an eye on oh you know
20:49
what maybe today's the day you should do this go through the chart interesting
20:57
let's clear these out well some of these charts kind of pulling back a little bit you know what
21:02
I mean nothing too alarming oh I saw there was more some Insider buying on FPA
21:13
small right it's the same dude every he's buying every other day oh and
21:19
I saw more cwho a little bit more oh I didn't see the sale
21:27
I didn't see that sale and options exercise Crestview
21:33
what what is that
21:39
Crestview how much did they own they so that was 30 of their position
21:53
what what the hell
22:02
oh oh that didn't work hold on damn some of these tickers don't they don't they don't populate just correctly
22:09
on well with them I think because tickers change and then
22:16
oh there it is oh they had a good chunk they owned almost five percent
22:23
as of quarter in they owned 4.2 what are they down to now what
22:30
what's going on 13.9 that means read that I might
22:36
remember misreading everything today what am I do you see this Crestview 4.3
22:42
shares held 4.3 owned 13.9
22:52
are there others like hesta and permit and GameStop they're two separate filings so that
22:58
sometimes get thrown off is this them too CW Crestview no whatever interesting
23:04
I was following it more for Abrams anyway I care more about what Abrams is doing then I don't even know crestviews all
23:10
right let's look them up
23:20
oh anything about them [Music] I don't know that's okay we'll keep
23:25
moving but he anyway I saw he was buying more every single day and then uh on the 21st is that today
23:31
no trade date yesterday he bought 250k a little bit more sizable so this is going to turn out to be a million bucks eight
23:37
one two three four five six seven ah yeah he's a million bucks he's a million
23:43
bucks see that I mean he's probably uber wealthy nevertheless uh but he pulled back it pulled back
23:48
quite a bit right I pulled back to like the 32 33 range
23:54
yeah I put noise but there's no down this chart looks a little bit bearish on the shorter term I
23:59
mean you see what I mean like super overbought not as much overbought never not even came close to pulling back this is a little bit bearish that's why we'll
24:06
do that today look through the charts
24:12
we don't need to keep going through prty this thing's all over the place huh this is oh this thing's
24:17
up down down up down I mean not much that's what I mean you pull you take a
24:23
step back it's not doing anything but uh you can understand why people who don't like volatility kind of shy away from these types of stocks but therein
24:29
lies the opportunity
24:35
oh fit fet pulling back um did I I may have added to it I may have added to it
24:41
slightly today you notice how still it's still a super small position it's not even half a percent but I think I added
24:47
20 it was already super small but I think I added 25 to it when I saw it pulled back it was uh after we talked
24:53
about oh that was it we talked about it on Wednesday right wasn't it up like 10 or 20 yesterday something dumb
24:58
you're talking about it like today right it was like Wednesday the 50s then it was up in 10 eyes is that 20 yeah it's
25:04
up 20 or something like what the hell I'm like uh the market must be watching this stream right they must be picking
25:10
up on what I'm gonna do I'm just kidding uh and anyway so I didn't pull the trigger yesterday on my app and then I'm
25:15
like I don't care I'm gonna pull back and then so I'm like all right I'll add a little bit today but uh plenty of time
25:21
on that one too no rush plenty of energy exposure blah blah blah
25:26
um if it's if fet is performing well fit um probably the energy industry is performing well in the whole run Kitty
25:33
portfolio is doing fine so that's how I'm kind of balancing out those risks but um I'll add on the pullback because of what we saw what was it what the
25:39
notes say just add the fat really thorough research that we did good thing we're
25:44
taking such thorough notes but I remember I remember
25:50
I remember it seemed like management was Cairn you know what I mean I what I didn't do was I didn't add to asps so
25:55
res I I know that was how we spent a good amount of time last time but um I didn't see any Rush
26:04
it's below 50 on the RSI not that I looked that up by um it's hard to explain I don't know I just
26:09
internalized that there was no super urgent rust plus I need to raise cash that's what I got to do but what's rezzie doing
26:16
probably below 10 is a good oh below 10 for both maybe damn this one
26:22
this chart's looking good okay
26:28
all right anything else worth checking up on today what do I need to see and everything's down
26:34
I guess some opportunity to trim oh BTE there we go real low
26:46
just turn up oh yeah yeah you know what every time I restart the computer I can't turn my little highlighter I need
26:51
a different highlighter I feel like I should be I don't have to click a button on the keyboard I mean if you're a gamer
26:56
you got your you get your one hand of the mouse one hand on the keyboard you're kind of doing that I don't I'm
27:01
not really there yet because I've come up with all these shortcuts to to not have to type something on the keyboard so I need a different shortcut should be
27:08
able to click oh why could I raise some cash yeah what the hell is this
27:13
oh yeah there we go boom I barely remember this one
27:22
look at that I'm basing on this alone I barely remember it I've I know of it Owens Illinois
27:28
um metal and glass
27:35
well what is it exactly manufacture sells glass containers yeah to food and beverage manufacturers
27:40
um could be an interesting business but um sorry based on what I recall of it
27:46
which is not very much I kind of just internalized these things and uh I remember it not being that great of a business maybe fundamentally I'll pull
27:52
it up but there's some cash right there not a huge position but uh all brfs
27:58
below four CRT oh some of these look kind of cheap
28:04
I should start at the bottom of the portfolio yeah yeah yeah look at this
28:09
I thought brfs was looking attractive right here and I I don't even think I bought it and then I'm like I missed out
28:15
on I missed out on a double and then and now here I got a oh that chart looks
28:20
interesting uh opportunity or the stuff see what I
28:27
mean okay we gotta look through these charts that's what we're doing today definitely
28:34
I always down uh 10 yeah see that I'm glad I kept this a small position because it's one of those speculative
28:39
ones that could go up big but this chart don't look good you know look at this this looks like it looks terrible
28:46
um look at this break that's a clean break and if it's because it's such a
28:52
speculative energy position this seems to be a little bit bearish for energy you know what I mean this could be a bull claim I don't know
29:01
some of these more riskier positions within an industry or sector if they start breaking it's like uh
29:09
uh is that one two three look at those five days that's bad that's bad uh what
29:14
are some other things we can check for kamado let's check that risk column all right I'm done on the daily Peabody
29:19
oh Peabody down too oh things looking oh things pulling back a little bit because people have Peabody's been at
29:25
250. 250 this whole damn time there you go
29:32
maybe everything bounces back strongly Monday right but just something for us to uh keep in mind
29:38
wow Peabody also one of those more speculative right coal I mean they got thermal and been allergical but still
29:46
what else we got mcf oh I think we're gonna see some bearish oh
29:54
all right we're definitely doing this today look at these big pullbacks today we'll see what happens Monday but in the meantime let's be prepared
30:02
all right not much WoW GameStop was the only great
30:07
so I see it's literally The only green one
30:13
it's the only green conditional formatting which that means above five percent it
30:18
was the only position buffer I didn't realize that today you know what I like I noticed stuff was down today but there
30:23
was no news today huh I mean I I saw like the Buckle performed
30:29
okay and uh and uh maybe that that's not enough that was a big 20 but
30:35
that's the thing was it's so heavily shorter than stuff it can pop it's just volatile but still we haven't seen it above five for quite some time so that's
30:41
why it was interesting but damn The only green I did not realize that okay
30:47
let's check um just a minute that are buying quick I didn't check that today maybe I did I don't even remember
30:55
oh was this someone new oh more prty party
31:02
different dude who's this guy that's not uh cliff
31:08
he's staying on PLC plc's PLC is in the portfolio I just trimmed that
31:19
all right let's see let's look him up he said who's he he's chairman of the board appealed holy okay he's chairman of
31:25
the board Norman Matthews oh he's been buying for a while
31:31
oh he's been buying for a while he owns PLC is Children's Place right
31:40
is this gonna break
31:47
oh what a pullback that's been it was up at like ah 50. I kind of missed that it's been halved ah
31:55
oh I had it I might have trimmed but I didn't trim as much as I should have and now it's
32:01
kind of pulling ah but uh so many there was a little bit a little Bubblicious there and some value
32:07
stocks okay who is this guy does he know what he's doing Norman Matthews
32:13
he's the chairman of the board so we can look this up
32:25
2009 wow well the company's done well since then right
32:30
oh I mean the past couple of years past year so that's rough but before then yeah it was looking good look at that
32:36
since he took since he took over if we're using this as a proxy oh sorry let me get 20.
32:43
took over in 2009 I mean this is this could also be coincidental right of the whole Market has been crushing since
32:48
2009 so maybe we're giving them credit where credit's not due just saying
32:55
it's quite the pullback though since 2018 but he was buying in his defense he was buying all the way down
33:01
always buying an ape in March and April props he's buying good prices too or what appeared to be good prices
33:11
hmm um anyway all right this will tell us a little bit
33:17
of his background has been appointed chair of the body successfully he succeeds
33:25
I just went back okay here we go and my selected director and listen to the channel series and the service and
33:31
the boys are progressive okay all right so he's a big time person on a whole bunch of boards
33:39
Federated Department Stores until it was 98. promoted that's it anything else what did he what
33:46
did he uh what did he do all right I don't see much just curious but anyway
33:52
someone else besides but still 500K meaningful
33:58
I missed that today well it just happened they just filed that at 18 10 was that 6 10
34:05
the whole Bank of Hawaii man I I looked at Bank of Hawaii right before it went up gigantic I never owned it
34:11
right here well you got to see that I looked at a lot of stuff that went up fall in 2012 but I legit looked at it
34:17
right there no it's this is reverse split this wasn't the price this is almost certainly reverse split right
34:22
that wasn't the price
34:29
was it
34:36
oh my maybe it had maybe it hasn't oh I could have sworn that sounds really high
34:42
Bank of Hawaii no Bank of the internet sorry yeah I thought it was Boh it was uh Boi
34:50
is that it have you ever heard of this one Bank of
34:55
Internet oh is that not a thing it's like B of I or something
35:02
oh damn is it is it still a thing Bank of Internet
35:10
am I making that up
35:17
nope okay so it's a real company I have to you can imagine creating false members which I'm guilty of don't make
35:22
no mistake it's not it's not Beyond is it no longer public
35:37
ah whatever oh did it change its name or something axos access bank ticker
35:42
see what I mean I go off on tangents now I'm just like I this is me trying to learn past uh Investments if a bank too
35:49
right I don't deal on banks too much but I remember looking at this and being like Oh that looks kind of interesting and I plus Bank of intimate Bank of
35:56
incident no brick and water stuff at the time this was like eight years ago
36:09
holy hell look at this sell-off huh jeez oh
36:22
what I don't know I don't know what this is so does that want to change this ticket Tony said
36:28
whatever sorry for Unnecessary tangent I don't even know okay Kodiak Sciences
36:35
oncs safe project a new flexshopper all right now I don't think it much else has happened
36:41
I did see this that was that today there was someone else too it's not Carl
36:49
200k notable help was that chart looking like looks
36:54
looks flat looks like it's not doing anything gosh yeah
37:01
we're like a couple days off I'm not buying in here
37:06
it's it's weird that I won't even do it as a starter position I don't know how to defend myself
37:12
it seems like I should at least just add it like I did cndt I don't know why I won't
37:18
I guess my thinking is this there's just no rush and it's right up against resistance and uh the upside is
37:24
relatively Limited for some reason I just uh I don't feel that incentivized
37:34
yeah it's not in there yet all right but someone else bought that's interesting that will be reflected
37:43
okay all right that I guess that was it I don't think I saw anything else Kinder Morgan ah Camping World we saw
37:51
tapestry yeah this one I've definitely owned this
37:56
in the past this is is this coach
38:03
they changed their name
38:11
oh okay good use yeah used to be coach right that coh
38:17
or something like that and then they changed their name and now they're tapestry
38:24
um it's kind of it's always it's always kind of been a dud and it never looked that cheap though there's the thing and look like I remember looking at it right
38:30
around in the 30s oh no okay I remember looking at it right around here it's just never that cheap and as it
38:37
turned out you're gonna say I'm gonna get lots of things wrong it never even doubled from there so I feel good about that it was even close to double and it
38:44
was that I mean oh it did double I apologize no but for me I mean trough to Peak okay if he got lucky and you timed
38:50
it perfectly um but that's not my type of uh position
38:57
so I um you know what I mean I'm learning off this I'm like yeah okay that was the
39:03
right analysis that it just didn't look like it was ever that cheap and if I said I don't remember but let
39:09
me check that off the oh I can't check it off because let me put it in the ad hoc sorry
39:17
let me looked at those oh different ticker TBR well I did not know the ticker
39:25
history I got so much consumer discretion on retail exposure I don't care that much but um
39:31
here's the thing you look at these and sometimes you already know the risk everyone does that kind of already know the risk for this one but um I don't
39:38
know if they have much of an edge to get some brand names Kate Spade and coach and stuff what else
39:43
Stuart Weitzman I don't even know that one
39:52
anyway I don't see much of Phillips 66 I saw
39:59
that one Lionsgate Del Taco oh you know what two things that I saw oh she said
40:04
two things this one taco but this one's I don't think is any is no longer cheap I looked at Taco back in March
40:13
I didn't pull the trigger I feel like I thought it was cheap below three I'm I kind of forget
40:30
I mean I kind of forget but I don't think it's cheap if I didn't pull the trigger at this at three or four I'm not pulling the trigger at eight
40:37
that's just gonna be that's gotta be an easy rule of thumb for me but one thing well I didn't see it just right now and I was scrolling through but uh BBQ
40:44
I saw um oh yeah someone else buy an Avis budget
40:49
saw that we saw fat okay so now we're where the
40:56
hell is BBQ I miss it yeah BBQ David Khan so I mentioned I feel like I've mentioned him before on the stream with
41:02
regard to um prts right there you go okay now so I saw it did catch my
41:09
attention and this used to be they just changed oh I missed this one
41:14
holy I missed the 800k purchase
41:20
holy Toledo all right now this guy's getting a little bit of a reputation with me personally you know what I mean he pulled off prts I gave him props for
41:27
that because I was right there with them but um I mean much bigger investor
41:33
but I mean it was right there like the same time we were looking at it and he was pulling the trigger and uh getting on the board and I think uh
41:41
I don't know I don't know atea oh Dave this estate oh he was in the oh
41:46
okay this is this is the former
41:54
Dave is now BBQ right
42:06
Famous Dave's yeah yeah yeah okay they changed their name to barbecue
42:12
Holdings and um there was some there was some seeking off articles about about this is there
42:18
any new ones what's his name now cards and conviction I remember this
42:24
back in the day this was 26 2017.
42:30
wow that was three years ago oh my that I remember it made me think that it
42:36
was more recent but um I don't know these people I don't know these
42:42
at least with cards and conviction I know what type of report he might be writing famous day as I recall it didn't get to
42:49
eight right was it was that chart well it got close to it if it didn't get
42:55
there
43:02
yeah nice work oh I mean he kissed it right still nevertheless
43:08
I mean it's a quick 50 at least that ain't bad oh man it's already up oh
43:14
[Music] wait when did he buy when did he buy this 3 15 345 I know I saw threes what the
43:22
hell when did you do this this weekly that's
43:29
weekly let me see the daily David David the 20th
43:35
the 20th and the 21st right 20th and the 21st
43:43
what what
43:50
am I 10 crazy pills wait a second what was the trade date the trade date
43:56
was August 19th and August 20th okay okay okay okay sorry I thought there was one on the
44:02
21st too but that was the filing date getting in my head what is this oh oh intraday sorry
44:10
so he just bought really early on the day ah okay I'll pull this up again I
44:16
remember looking I remember looking somewhat interesting but not that interesting I'll check it off
44:22
but check it off I mean slash type it in the ad hoc
44:30
didn't look like it was that interesting but now but now but to be sure when I
44:36
was looking at it I was looking at it back I guess back in 2017 based on these
44:41
the timing of these articles and in 2015 it was 354 bucks didn't look that compelling I mean now it just now it
44:48
just popped up a lot of David you gotta make your transactions earlier you know what I mean I mean if it pops two days
44:53
after you make your make your purchases what the hell am I gonna do
44:59
bummer so would it sell off after oh no that was March it was looking good that
45:04
chart's holding up well but I would have needed I would have needed something there's no way I would have pulled
45:10
there's no way I would have pulled the trigger on this base so this chart doesn't look that good either
45:16
now I'm intrigued though so let's remember this do I have David uh I should add David
45:22
Conan too so I I have my you do I have my universe thing up
45:30
well I don't have it up right now I'm gonna pull that up because I I definitely want to make some notes I had a
45:35
something oh add to Universe I should add these to you Universe I didn't do that the other day
45:44
I'll do that today all right so that was something that I
45:51
saw and I thought okay I remember this one and I'm like and we just had talked about I don't even know how to pronounce
45:57
David Conan come in Conan whatever um but with prts and I saw him pull the
46:03
trigger I'm like all right I'll pay attention although I don't know if he has a board seat on this company not that it should not that it matters that
46:09
much
46:19
oh is this still their website their website is still famous dave's.com it can't be is it
46:24
okay they just have it redirecting I was gonna be like what that would have been crazy I can't
46:30
Rebrand I still keep the same domain name
46:37
how the hell where's come on here we go
46:42
corporate governance let's just check I just want to see if uh Dave famous Famous Dave Kane
46:50
oh there you go huh it's not that's that's I don't believe that is what it's named after but that's kind of cool
47:02
nope okay there's so many wow see what I mean small companies how big is this company
47:09
42 million two people listed executive management two people how about board of directors
47:14
oh oh how is it oh is this the company
47:19
no woody wait a second wait a second wait a second wait a second do I get them wrong
47:30
what was his relation to oh did it change its names car it never
47:35
used to be carparts.com that wasn't the name
47:45
it was U.S auto parts I knew they changed their name I was gonna say I don't remember this name
47:51
this name don't look familiar when was this July of 2020. all right can I get a pass
47:57
it just happened like three weeks ago let me get a pass on that
48:03
hmm
48:10
I should update on the universe not that it matters that much
48:16
I remember him being appointed to the board of directors
48:30
let me just check I just want to see um just want to see is he just a director
48:36
on the company for the company okay you know what I think I forgot that he was now that I'm seeing I vaguely
48:42
remember I I could have sworn he was a chairman of the board of a company but I guess I kind of just thought it was this
48:47
company oh they redid their website looks a little bit uh I mean uh Slicker I haven't looked at it
48:54
in 18 months
49:00
come on where's your uh governance thank you uh board of directors
49:05
no that's not him okay he's not even on the board
49:15
no it was just a 10 owner all right all right all right I'm piecing to get the story you know what I mean it was never a director
49:21
okay okay all right this is uh increasingly compelling you know what I mean he took
49:27
his he took his time he had bought that he had bought into um Dave back in the day
49:34
when was his last purchase let's do this ah
49:39
let's do this Dave okay oh so we open inside will link some his
49:46
last purchase was see what I mean his last purchase was March 2019.
49:52
it was 250k then he hasn't done since so he's kind of like all right
49:58
this was after his May 2018. so he here we go piece in the store together right
50:04
he took a increases position 50 percent in May 2018. so going on two and a half
50:12
years ago and then he added a little bit in August
50:17
and then he added a little bit in 2019 real this has been a slow burn then he
50:22
sold a little bit November noise four percent then he add then he's been added and he
50:29
added 18 so he added foreign
50:38
and he was buying a prices well above look at this I don't have the thing the damn highlighter he was buying at six and
50:46
seven dollars I remember thinking remember I just said how I I was um
50:51
looking out at the same time as cardigan conviction three four five bucks whatever it is and then I vaguely
50:56
remember seeing this guy buying at six seven dollars and thinking what the hell are you doing I don't remember I didn't
51:02
remember it being David Conan but I remember thinking what the hell because I never thought it was that
51:09
attractive even at four and five and I remember thinking what the hell
51:16
but now he's kind of proved himself a little bit to me prts and I know he really cares about Rowan Kitty's opinion you know what I mean like really he
51:22
really cares deeply about it but um
51:28
now he's starting to buy back in Wings huh
51:34
Wings Famous Dave's did I pull it up
51:45
seven let's take a peek I gotta see this this could be a 44 what is it what did I say 40 million
51:53
okay prts is now 600 million
51:59
oh 600 million for this when I was looking I was like 100 million ah suck
52:09
oh I'm sorry can we do a quick can we do a quick quick break because I did see
52:15
today Tesla broke 2000. sorry see what I mean looking at a chart making me laugh what
52:21
do I think of except for Tesla how do you not we call this we call this I'm toted a million other people
52:28
but come on this was in this was uh you can't say inevitable but if you
52:34
take it you get your finger on the pulse of the market and 2K now from here much less certain
52:41
much lesser hold on I'm gonna pull this up quick quick quick break
52:47
we're looking at it yeah what is this did they announce the split write about was it a week ago 21st
52:56
he knew it was coming for 2000 it's ridiculous you know it was coming for two thousand now what now it's all right
53:01
let's see what happens so boom boom if you're a Tesla along well you want it to break above I know I know it's just
53:08
charts and stuff how about the weekly yeah that was really bullish early this
53:15
year you're gonna need quite the run where are you gonna go where you gonna go
53:21
Ghostbuster 400 billion
53:26
I don't know no I mean I I didn't look at the call should I have
53:31
bought calls for 2 000 maybe I should have but what I'm gonna buy near-term calls come on
53:38
I did really think that it was going to hit 2K but time frame and everything like that and
53:44
I didn't I assume they're super expensive a lot of options these days the vix is so damn High
53:50
a lot of these options are so expensive let me get some GameStop options even those look kind of rich and I'm like ah
53:57
how do you start adding to these types of positions so I didn't see them but anyway we'll see what happens from here
54:04
but this is hilarious dude oh all right sorry about that but
54:12
anyway this how did I forget I forgot to tell look at this
54:17
this is painful this is painful ah
54:26
so many 10 Baggers so many 10 Baggers I guess it's reassuring from an investment
54:32
style too even though I didn't capture all of them the style holds water I I
54:38
said this in my investment Style video I don't even remember I recorded that so long ago but like
54:43
this works the style of investing works I know it's not for everybody and that's perfectly fine everyone has their own
54:49
unique style but like 10 Bakers a bond with this style and you kind of just gotta look for the right things and position this position the um
54:57
excuse me size the positions accordingly but uh I mean how many 10 Baggers have
55:02
we seen like you just have to take my word and a lot of them have been tracking and yeah indeed I didn't capture all of them but that's been a
55:08
criticism of the approach we never I've never none of us have had like an opportunity like we had in March and
55:13
April and every every bear Mark is different blah blah blah I get all that but even
55:18
even still I remember the thought crossed my mind and now I'm like all right but I didn't want to it
55:25
doesn't matter oh man such a huge win anyway David Conan was right with that one
55:33
all right let's take a peek of this where are we here we go
55:38
well that's quite the bump up in our revenues nice job
55:45
kind of Flat Line there so they probably I I vaguely remember them taking some initiatives to trying to I thought I
55:52
don't remember if it was boosting revenues to boost in profitability whatever just remember them doing stuff
55:58
which like I said sometimes that's enough sometimes that's enough for me because
56:03
you see so many management teams that either aren't doing anything or just I don't mean I mean yeah it kind of
56:09
seems like they don't care or they're not cutting costs or whatever this is what I mean like GameStop it kind of
56:14
seems like they they care um not the most not like the most I've ever seen a management care or anything
56:20
like that I don't mean that I just mean it seems like they're taking steps to um to write to
56:26
um uh correct the trajectory if you will but other there's other management teams are like they're like
56:33
they'll burn themselves down to try to get the company to survive and stuff like I'm not saying that's what's happening here but I I just like to see
56:39
that um and um look at this that's a huge jump up what is that 50 rise 50 Revenue
56:46
growth I'll have to check out the uh
56:52
check out the news releases on this one jeez all right let's take a peek at this it's
56:57
been a year since I've looked at this I'll take a peek
57:03
all right what's okay how are we doing relative to revenue so what do we got for revenues what's uh sales all right so not that cheap based on revenues
57:12
trades at fifty percent of Revenue so you kind of price it on some growth there I'd say because this is going to be a thin margin business look at this
57:18
no surprise here right this is these are tough businesses you've everyone says that Buffett I'm sure it's
57:24
almost certainly said I can't remember um these are tough businesses really
57:29
thin margins I mean and then everything that's going on right now huh I mean
57:35
some of these Russians had to close their doors and a lot of them are toast I mean you see this you're gonna see this in local cities and stuff
57:44
and yet this company has a two percent profit margin over the past 12 months I know it's only been one person one
57:50
quarter of really terrible business but um still
57:58
no yeah no Devon okay operating cash flow just turned a little bit negative you know I don't love that
58:05
slightly negative slightly negative but prior to this year
58:12
so like I don't like negative operating cash flow right but um there's no one
58:19
David kind of I don't even know this guy right I'm just using him as an example uh there's no more dialed into this
58:26
negative operating cash flow then director oh it is a 10 owner oh I don't even know that
58:33
like there's no more dialed into this negativeness negativity then uh than the Insiders this is why
58:40
the Insiders can be so informative um and so if they see what's going on on the operating cash flow front or
58:45
whatever whatever the risk is whatever the latest risk is and they're still buying and you have reason to believe that they kind of know what they're
58:51
doing you don't always know that just because you can't just blindly assuming The Insider is buying that's good news but uh then I think all right okay then
58:58
I care much less about the fact that it's negative operating cash flow you know what I mean you gotta weight all these against each other what the hell
59:04
am I doing how much is he own I don't know if he has a fund so I don't
59:09
know if I can look it up 15 percent holy who is Joseph Jacob someone's 18 oh
59:16
is he the founder oh Wexford Capital wait a second
59:21
that about that's it Joseph Jacobs value fund and Bandera
59:27
Patrick Walsh isn't he um the uh workout The Workout Company
59:32
what's it called um which is now up I had owned it in the past
59:38
what's the name of that company um town is it town
59:47
no it's uh Town Sports I don't know I forget the ticker Club
59:54
I'm pretty sure this is Patrick Walsh right
1:00:03
seven nope is that not him seven is Bandera
1:00:09
wait a second all right let's okay we need to get a whole so there's a lot of action on this
1:00:15
uh beneficial owners um sometimes you'll see me pull this up I'm certain I have and there's like one
1:00:20
or two things that are noteworthy in it more stuff more stuff happening here first of all the CEO three percent
1:00:27
it's not a lot but it's something CFO nothing so forget the internet management now we got
1:00:33
the directors and or I mean the outside funds are kind of like running the show Here For Better or Worse this is like
1:00:39
kind of what Carl does too it's kind of what what's happening with Sandra at Jesse is like it they got control of this for For
1:00:46
Better or Worse usually with a competent person or fund or whatever it is it's for better
1:00:52
um
1:00:58
here he owned 1.4 which is 15 of the time how much does he own now
1:01:04
1.6 so he's out a little bit about 20 percent
1:01:11
Peter Hague and Joseph Jacobs Joseph Jacobs says almost certainly Wexford capital
1:01:20
isn't Wexford Capital uh um what's six the Bellow investors can you see that
1:01:27
you can see that
1:01:32
I gotta look this up maybe I
1:01:42
value oriented all right I saw that in the Google results there
1:01:48
right down here value oriented multi-strategy investment firm all right something value I mean a lot of people
1:01:56
just say that but uh if you're dealing it if you call yourself a value from and you're dealing with these types of
1:02:01
stocks it tends to mean uh you're a Bonafide University you know I mean a lot of
1:02:07
people the people who are like phony value investors it's like Oh I'm a value investor I'm buying
1:02:12
um I mean think of any prominent uh large gigantic company um
1:02:19
um I mean I can't pull out most of these days Mo these days just about everything
1:02:24
um Procter and Gamble you know what I mean I can't come up with something fast enough Procter and Gamble I'm buying
1:02:30
program we're like all right okay you're buying Procter Gamble but uh you know that's not my type of value investing you know what I mean like Okay
1:02:36
um so uh I was gonna say like Berkshire Hathaway and apple and all these things but these are there's like well-run companies you know what I mean people
1:02:42
say value investing they just mean I buy well-run companies which in turn they're just mimicking the S P 500 but if you
1:02:47
call yourself a value investor and you're dealing in I don't mean I'm not knocking I
1:02:52
apologize barbecue Holdings but I mean as far as the institutions are concerned if uh such a small company they they
1:02:59
turn their nose up at you and uh or if you get a lot of hair on all of that stuff uh like Clifford sosin right this the
1:03:06
party Holdings there and um and um what's the other one home like
1:03:12
those are really questionable company suspect companies if you're dealing on those and you call yourself value shop like I kind of like all right I'm paying
1:03:18
attention so I don't know Wexford at all but the fact that they're dealing a barbecue although it's a little bit a little bit less meaningful just because
1:03:24
there's other things there appears to be other people involved I I don't know we'll see
1:03:31
to investing instead of not buying quality assets that attractive prices blah blah no um Charles Davidson and Joseph Jacobs
1:03:37
with more than five decade investment careers all right this isn't who whatever I was thinking about beforehand is not
1:03:50
Charles Davidson Joseph Jacobs let's look up him sponsor forever seeing
1:03:55
embarrass turns bankruptcies and restructurings all right
1:04:01
um Harvard and Warren all right not a doofus I see this I I I'm not knocking
1:04:07
everything not a doofus site that's what I think and I think um that that sounds that sounds to me and I
1:04:14
don't mean it like that I mean uh like I have I can't read this and be like this person definitely knows what
1:04:20
they're doing because oh you I've thought that before and I think it just doesn't work out that way so more importantly I'm just thinking do they
1:04:25
have some sort of experience that telegraphs to me that they're not completely ignorant of what it takes to
1:04:31
turn around a business or whatever blah blah blah this is how I view myself too like I don't I just view myself as like
1:04:36
I try not to be really stupid about things and this is how I try to assess management as well it's like they don't seem like they're totally ignorant of
1:04:43
what it takes that's all I mean um and Joseph Jacobs seems like he's got a history I mean you work in a bear
1:04:48
Stearns Harvard Business School Wharton School come on I mean uh and they kind of know what's going on I don't know
1:04:53
their history of of security analysis or anything like that which
1:04:59
not that I can do about that unless they have it some some of these companies publish it that's like like total Publishers and I'm like oh this is sick
1:05:05
and then you kind of know what you're dealing with there and I respect that buy high quality assets at this local
1:05:10
prices no I mean that's what I mean like that everyone wants that but um okay
1:05:20
I think I'm pretty sure how many Patrick Walsh I mean Patrick Walsh does sound like a little bit of a common name but there's a
1:05:29
I'll tell you how I can figure it out
1:05:37
damn wait how much did he own
1:05:43
it says he owns seven percent so is this not him thanks New York that's him ain't it
1:05:51
bjri all right so he's dealing on these types of companies uh this would be surprising without him but whatever
1:05:58
okay so who it no so we know that's Wexford bender and Bandera they kind of I've had some overlap with them before I
1:06:05
wouldn't say I've had a the companies that I've had overlap with them that I've had a tremendous amount of success but um they have experience as a fund
1:06:13
I don't need to look them up a lot of small cap stuff look at this all directors all directors
1:06:20
and uh executive officers 40 you do not see that very often
1:06:25
40 percent and which one and really only Renaissance doesn't count for much that's five percent so 35 percent
1:06:32
Patrick Walsh Bandera and Wexford they get control of this
1:06:38
all right real talk I've kind of seen it left I've seen enough
1:06:45
I've seen enough small cap company these peeps got control of the company
1:06:51
David Conan's involved connect he's a non-executive he's the chairman of the
1:06:56
board he's been in this since 2018 wrote it all about kind of getting trying to get to the other side
1:07:02
uh hasn't sold this is as far as I'm concerned that's that don't sell them
1:07:07
for tax purposes or something I don't care um all right now I'm a little bit excited about this oh not many notes so
1:07:14
far today all right I'm gonna I'm gonna say this right right
1:07:20
right off the bat then let's just do a little bit more research
1:07:27
um
1:07:35
chairman aboard with uh greater than uh let's just call fifteen
1:07:41
percent this is probably this would be enough while we're looking at the note um
1:07:48
uh Patrick Walsh Bandera
1:07:53
and and what do we say at wex what's it called Wexford
1:08:18
really do you see what I mean so you saw the GameStop video right I could I can make a damn video on this
1:08:24
in 20 seconds I'm not done analyzing yet that's the important part here you need to
1:08:29
understand that hopefully you do by now you're starting to get a feel for my style this is enough this is the stuff that you don't really
1:08:35
like see in like books and stuff like that you know what I mean like there's other stuff going on besides the
1:08:41
fundamental I mean we get the fundamentals up that's what I'm going to dig into in just a second but um
1:08:46
there's a story being told here by who's involved their actions they're taking on
1:08:51
the open market the their involvement on the board and all that stuff and I'm not saying it always works out I'm not
1:08:57
saying that uh I'm just saying these are positive I consider these fundamentals to I mean
1:09:04
I these are positive fundamentals in my mind I know it's not traditional fundamentals as most people see them but whatever
1:09:11
I mean who cares I don't care what I care about are the returns
1:09:16
is there anything else to say there for so far and then um I know let me say his full name that'll help me
1:09:23
remember it I by now I know but
1:09:32
I'm gonna assume it's the same Patrick Walsh why why would I go to seven though can I just check this maybe it's not
1:09:39
look at seven so he Patrick Walsh number seven mid-air pardon is the investment um sorry I don't know if you can hear me
1:09:44
I know I'm leaning away um he took Gregory Jefferson
1:09:53
why why why what huh that's weird
1:10:06
this guy must be him right yeah I'm pretty sure this is him yep
1:10:11
there you go Club
1:10:16
Wesleyan Boston College I've read this before he's a CFA chart holder
1:10:23
really what
1:10:33
yes after kind of here in the CFA
1:10:39
Prudential Prudential Deutsche Bank oh he worked at Deutsche oh okay that's right I did remember him having a
1:10:45
background in finance I remember now this is Meaningful to look up to because he's got control of um Town Sports now
1:10:51
I've owned a position to tell he's the CEO he's got a good chunk I've had a position in town sports but I think
1:10:57
either it got triggered by a stop loss but well I don't remember but after covet I'm like I'm not I wasn't I don't
1:11:04
want to plan on rebuilding and then I thought maybe it was a mistake did something happen with that um
1:11:12
no nothing nothing really happened it got bit up with everything else it was a triple you know what I mean see
1:11:17
what I mean like was a triple you you just buy you buying triples you sell then you trim
1:11:24
um now it's coming back down yeah so it just did it again this is a week ago whoa yeah
1:11:32
anyway I thought they might struggle with everything that was going on that was my armchair interpretation of
1:11:38
gyms and stuff but I remember looking into his background I didn't remember he was a
1:11:44
I remember using volume finds I remember he was a CFA charterholder nor did I remember he was it going to bank and
1:11:50
equity research and stuff but I remember thinking kind of knows this stuff and then he kept on Buying Club
1:11:56
this I think was a purchase I'm pretty sure he was buying this off of one of the PE firms that was involved which I
1:12:02
thought was not super bullish like there was a PE firm involved and it
1:12:08
looked like he was buying the shares from them and I thought oh that's that's not buying it on the open market that's that's totally different you're you're
1:12:14
taking the shares off someone else's hands who's like I don't want this and I'm like maybe they maybe that firm was
1:12:19
um maybe they were dialed into um the pin like coronavirus and stuff
1:12:24
and maybe they're like I don't want this because that would be impressive it was what November or December it seems kind of early but who I don't
1:12:31
know I have no idea Jesus that would be something
1:12:37
all right Welsh invested in town Sports in it and said that the Fitness business had been worse
1:12:44
is this real is this real where is this
1:12:51
where's this uh August 2015. worst investment
1:13:02
I don't feel like reading it did he really say that though I don't care no that's a ride if you did say that
1:13:09
okay anyway you see this and the guys like uh he's not a cuckoo head you know what I mean there you go
1:13:14
and I guess that's why I remembered his name and so he's involved too and again this isn't always a good thing
1:13:21
but uh I like to see this uh all El sequel all
1:13:27
else equals so now let me just take one more peek at the fundamentals here am I gonna go heavy
1:13:33
I can't go heavy I need a stronger they earned 60 cents over the past 12
1:13:39
months 60 cents
1:13:44
on an electron 60 cents on uh revenues up 50 percent
1:13:50
what so look at the balance sheet here I'm seeing two bucks two bucks in Book value
1:13:57
you know what I mean that's on a four dollar share price uh
1:14:03
um at this debt it's probably just leases that debt there okay I don't know who cares
1:14:12
ebitda 77 cents it's not that cheap it's not that cheap
1:14:18
10 times ebita you're at seven bucks but the question is are they growing and if they're growing revenues couldn't you
1:14:23
envision them growing um profitability too maybe they're going to get margins up there are two percent they want they're
1:14:30
two percent right now what if they got back to four percent you'd have to think that they can get back to four percent right if they're if they care and
1:14:35
they're trying all right and if they get back to four percent net margins what do you have
1:14:49
almost 4 million let's call it four million
1:15:00
am I doing that right why am I getting 44 cents
1:15:21
something that I don't know thumbs on added up
1:15:28
because this is three year average see what I mean I've been scrolling over quite a bit you know what I mean
1:15:35
maybe I should redo these spreadsheets now it's kind of sold the thing is I I've been focusing mostly on these two
1:15:41
spreadsheets it wouldn't be that much to change but like maybe I should have that's the thing I want everything on one view anyway this two percent is it's
1:15:48
gonna be um this year's when I scroll over we're going to see a higher than two
1:15:55
percent trailing 12 month net margin it's going to be
1:16:01
six percent is it going to be six percent let's say
1:16:08
I nailed it got it you can tell all right I um
1:16:22
so obviously these negative years are dragging down those the three year average debt margin right I should know you know I should know that by now but I
1:16:28
I can't see the damn average three you know what I mean like I tried I included it up here but I don't include it all over the
1:16:33
place so unless I I should maybe undo that just so I could see ah
1:16:39
I should have you I should have used this spreadsheet more before I duplicated it so many times now I don't feel like fixing it all right so six six
1:16:45
percent net margins ain't bad but how much upside do they have what was Peak net margin but it now now I'm
1:16:52
like What's the upside so first of all they're already doing a damn good job they got two straight years of six percent which is their Peak that margin
1:17:00
look at this
1:17:07
I believe if I recall correctly and I need to dig into the story for this though but I recall they were trying to
1:17:13
do more of a licensing model where you would like license the brand like more like a McDonald's type thing right where
1:17:18
they um like license the the brand name I think
1:17:23
which is going to be higher profit margins right that's a better business model maybe you can't be as large
1:17:29
but it's a it's an asset like business model um higher profitability
1:17:37
is that what they're doing that's how this is a lot of Revenue growth that's probably what they're doing uh
1:17:44
I'll I'll look into the story I just before I get to but when I say Story I mean I want to check the press releases I want to check the press releases over
1:17:50
the past 18 months there's not that many there's not going to be that many
1:17:56
news impressed they're small companies there's really not me you get the quarterly you get the quarterly reports
1:18:02
and I like to see that this is it I just look at all this stuff to acquire assets I mean we can start with this I suppose
1:18:15
and innovate in innovating Global owner in operator restaurants cool
1:18:23
company on Famous Dave says company owned famous so so they have company-owned stores then they have
1:18:28
other stores that people are operating on their behalf decreased 23 okay
1:18:36
franchise operated decreased 32 percent
1:18:42
what
1:18:51
what how do you have such a big Decline and
1:18:57
that revenues are up so much wait a damn second either the numbers are wrong either the numbers in the spreadsheet
1:19:02
are wrong which we've already seen that have before in the past or this is a tremendous opportunity these revenues
1:19:07
are up 50 50 of the pesto almost despite this huge quarterly sell-off there's no is that possible if that's possible
1:19:15
let's see this no there was an acquisition right so we saw there was an acquisition these press releases down here
1:19:21
to acquire assets of Granite City Food and Brewery we'll get to this in just a second but uh okay
1:19:28
okay this is interesting
1:19:34
okay so second quarter net sales decree what's this Granite City second quarter same store net sales decreased 66
1:19:42
percent Is that real can you even decline that much
1:19:49
what oh is that real bad timing on the acquisition huh when do you acquire them
1:19:56
February oh that's rough oh that's that's
1:20:06
a lot of companies in this position right where they took actions in January February whatever December January
1:20:11
February and this happened so many companies are in this position and um
1:20:17
all right so it's just a restaurant good website
1:20:23
local chain in that area maybe okay
1:20:34
wow that's a huge decline and even even more than GameStop huh
1:20:42
adjusted ebitda adjusted ebit all adjusted right but still flat I mean a million right but
1:20:49
that's pretty impressive considering how much sales decline say I'm still same store sales
1:21:00
during the four weeks ended okay I was gonna say well Granite City's getting walloped
1:21:08
in July they were down 33 year over year uh what it wouldn't they couldn't it was
1:21:13
tough but uh it turned out as it turned out ill-timed acquisition right Palmer
1:21:18
I mean if you waited six months you would have got a discount company probably would have file bankruptcy
1:21:24
entered into two franchisees agreements PDX Partners offer famous food delivery services right
1:21:31
quarter's been challenging this is probably a good food delivery business though right was it wings barbecue food
1:21:39
competition among the change you got Buffalo Wild Wings
1:21:44
they all deliver now right because they can all use GrubHub and all that or whatever okay this quarter has been uh
1:21:51
been challenged with continual changes in state and local I'm proud our team blah blah blah
1:21:56
social media Granite food is a grain of food and Brew is a concept that relies much more
1:22:02
heavily on dining sales in the initial to go only restrictions severely
1:22:07
severely handled hampered Sales locations ugh that sucks
1:22:12
but an opportunity you know what I mean this could be I'm not obviously this isn't a complaint right I don't even own
1:22:19
the stock but this results in a potential opportunity where they uh business is dragging them but because of
1:22:25
this this acquisition and now the price is lower than it ever has been before 100 is this the one that
1:22:31
just got bit up right before what why why did I give it up when was
1:22:37
this published August 12th it doesn't make any sense because he was by was he is he the volume is that where I got bit
1:22:43
up all right sorry well we have been prudent in managing
1:22:48
our cash as the stores are open we continue to be concerned about the future direction of the kova 19 pandemic and therefore we'll manage our cash
1:22:54
appropriately we are very pleased to see the resiliency of Famous Dave's during this pandemic
1:22:59
all right uh for the three months ended uh franchise operated from 107 to 95
1:23:05
yikes company owned from 29 to 50. well there goes my theory I could
1:23:11
is it just because of the nature of the environment why did that go up I could have sworn they were trying to go more to franchise operate maybe maybe they're
1:23:17
not maybe had the story wrong
1:23:23
I would have thought that that would have been a more profitable business now
1:23:29
restaurant oh my raycroc that's his name right
1:23:34
look at these two oh look at these declines I mean this is gonna you're gonna see that I don't I'm not invested in too many restaurants but I'm certain
1:23:40
you're going to see similar numbers across the board we'll see how look
1:23:48
I don't even have an Outlook but I mean this looks ugly right and I wonder it's no wonder was in the gutter did it did
1:23:54
it sell off that day what did they announce no
1:23:59
flat flat on the announcement kind of people priced in which begs the question why the hell did it go up
1:24:06
is it him buying buying all those shares what's the volume
1:24:11
look at this is just him on volume I think it's just how often do you see that you know what
1:24:17
I mean let's see I think it might be so that's the thing like these stocks
1:24:23
just like with um actually GameStop today there's just no volume and then when volume perks up for whatever reason
1:24:29
who cares it just takes off because there's no volume there's it's by Demand right
1:24:35
um who's selling this who's left to sell you know geez the short sellers I guess
1:24:40
but um here too look it's overbought it went from 50 on the RSI to overbought in three
1:24:49
days and then we see how many shares 300
1:24:55
200 500 and how many of them were him look at he was 250.
1:25:04
this might come back this might come back if it's just him driving it up I mean that happens but
1:25:10
on August 20th he bought two he bought 250.
1:25:23
what doesn't say 200.
1:25:29
what huh oh traded August 19th thank you I was
1:25:36
like what all right so he bought 37k that day which was one fifth roughly of
1:25:43
the volume but on this day he bought 250.
1:25:48
he would he bought 250 August 19th he bought 250. the volume was 300. he's the volume this
1:25:56
is this might come back to earth
1:26:04
stock probably popped on 819 because conambot
1:26:12
okay shares on total 320k volume something like that
1:26:20
you know what I mean like
1:26:26
so it pops right and then it kind of just holds up like the nuances of the market right
1:26:32
like this is just how it works any any efficient market like give me a break right I mean it's just so silly I
1:26:39
don't know if you buy into that theory it's like oh it's beautiful on paper but it's not how the real world Works sorry
1:26:45
um let's see what happens here I think this might come back though if
1:26:52
it's just him buying it up that's not enough maybe this holds up for a couple days because the the Algos pick up on it taking off and stuff but uh but it
1:26:59
doesn't look that cheap to me oh what what sticks out to me is this 97 is
1:27:04
that accurate did it really just pop that much six months six months
1:27:11
this looks like it could be right
1:27:17
I mean it's already so in the six months ended June 2020.
1:27:23
50 million and the six months ended and they had 63 million total so it's in
1:27:31
the ball it's not totally bizarre plus those damn net margins inclusive of
1:27:37
this crappy shitty quarter jeez really you know what I mean look at
1:27:44
these so I don't I apologize I'm scrolling six percent two consecutive 24 month
1:27:52
period where they averaged almost six percent total which was by far
1:27:57
higher than any other time any other year except for 2002 which could have been
1:28:04
it's so high nine percent that it could be like a tax benefit or something higher than every other year geez
1:28:11
doesn't that Telegraph tea doesn't that kind of make it seem like they know what they're doing and we know they have control of it
1:28:17
that's what I mean like I mentioned this with um GameStop too like the uh gross margin improving year over year with all
1:28:24
that's going on Revenue declining all that stuff um cost management if if and again if
1:28:30
that's what I mean if this if these margins are as stable as they are and that much higher given what happened especially in the past quarter holy
1:28:38
kind of feels kind of seems like they know what they're doing I don't I don't I feel I don't feel as
1:28:44
though there's a ton of margin of safety on like the balance it always comes down about I know we haven't even looked at the balance sheet uh
1:28:53
let's pull it up I'm gonna get to them charts I'm not
1:28:58
forgetting about them charts don't worry Bob Hope look at this open Insider it really takes us down some paths huh all
1:29:04
right cash 20 million how many shares outstanding let's remember that nine I
1:29:09
had two two bucks that ain't bad two bucks in cash
1:29:15
assets held for sale I like that raise
1:29:21
an extra four sick
1:29:31
all right this threw me off total current assets 33 fixed assets 33.
1:29:38
look at this big jump pump that's because of the acquisition in both current assets oh what's good is
1:29:46
that the current assets jump looks like cash sick
1:29:54
a lot of it sick okay uh but then you see the fixed assets
1:29:59
okay I forget the leases whatever Goodwill intangibles uh
1:30:08
all right I like the 20 million in cash
1:30:18
I mean that's half the market cap right there that's no joke
1:30:23
something should be lighting up green over here don't I have this right here oh yeah oh you can't see it let me Flip
1:30:28
Flip Flip It Don't Feel let me move this over
1:30:34
so right here oh no
1:30:42
see if I can fit the screen oh me I messed I messed up my OBS let me see if I can fit that do you see the black screen you see the black top on on your
1:30:49
end fit the screen there we go um they threw me off I was going to
1:30:55
click on OBS not not the first time I've done that that's for sure right here
1:31:00
um cash is a percentage of price I'd like to check on that sometimes just um like if you're trading like five bucks
1:31:06
and you get two or three bucks in cat I mean this that's why GameStop is one of the reasons GameStop price is silly to me actually let me see so right cash is
1:31:13
a percentage of the price you got 50 bucks on the books it's not free cash and blah blah blah but still
1:31:21
um still is supporting the thinking being suppose I don't want to get into it uh
1:31:28
but what is GameStop by the way cash is a percentage it's gonna be absurd ain't it yeah
1:31:33
160 percent now if you saw in the video I mean
1:31:39
that's not net cash right you got debt and you also have the revolver I included the revolver in my Enterprise
1:31:45
Value calculation um in the net cash positions will then like 20 million or something but uh but
1:31:52
regardless positive net okay that's the thing you don't see companies trading that cheaply with a positive net cash position so I'm sorry but anyway as a
1:31:59
percentage of price cash is uh 160 these are the things that catch my attention because it um it it reduces it or it
1:32:08
strengthens the margin of safety do you know what I mean so that's what I see here with uh barbecue Holdings
1:32:15
50 cash still I would like more I'd like more
1:32:20
um but not that this looks okay I mean there's a question on what the hell these fixed assets actually worth you know what I mean what are they actually
1:32:26
worth I don't know
1:32:31
but I like the 20 million in cash you know what I mean like the majority of current assets are cash that's sick
1:32:42
what's Book value look at this so Book value is 30 million
1:32:48
oh that's not tangible Book value though
1:32:54
look at the retained earnings look at how much it just grew
1:33:00
in the six months it grew six seven man that uh were they when they
1:33:06
looks like they're doing a good job Mike either they're doing some accounting they're uh I'm a bad analyst or
1:33:16
like it kind of looks like they're doing a good job doesn't it what did they earn quite a bit of money in q1 was there a
1:33:22
gain some weird gain or something yeah there you go see you know you're
1:33:28
gonna get it yeah like something doesn't quite add up there's a gain on a bargain purchase
1:33:33
that's not operating earnings operating it there was a loss in q1 and
1:33:40
there's a loss in Q2 but because of this gain on bargain purchase I don't even know what that means
1:33:50
sometimes you see it as an income tax benefit too all right that kind of explains things a little bit more but
1:33:55
still the revenue is no joke look at revenues for these three months doubled 100 percent
1:34:02
sick so I'm not as much concerned with the this is why Revenue this is why I like
1:34:07
revenues and you'll read this in books and stuff is that um I like revenues as uh let me
1:34:12
flip back I like revenues as um
1:34:18
as a a variable in general because it's it's just more
1:34:23
difficult to manipulate you know what I mean it's like um I see this jump up and I think all right that's that's a big jump up maybe acquisition
1:34:31
um other stuff but that's about it but then I see earnings jump up like it could be a tax benefits could be some other weird
1:34:38
I gain on an asset sale or something and um but um that's what I mean it's like that
1:34:44
Revenue jumps nice all right so so pay less attention to the earnings yield and all that stuff
1:34:49
because there's some um some gains and stuff going on but so goes to the retained earnings still
1:34:55
you see that what was that game the game was like what 10 14k or something it kind of explains
1:35:00
the jump and retained earnings and Book value and stuff all right not a tremendous amount of of downside
1:35:08
protection in this case not a tremendous amount and especially
1:35:15
I'm not going to operating cash flow too it's not like I'm seeing a ton of operating cash flow
1:35:21
this is worth a position though maybe if it pulls back
1:35:30
anyone written anything on it no right we just looked that up we didn't see anything
1:35:38
2019 see no one's even talking about it no one's even talking about it
1:35:46
okay whatever
1:36:08
and let me just pull up um
1:36:16
I just want to pull up the cash flow statement real quick can I see anything interesting there
1:36:21
looks like I mean he he was by kind of Dave David kanem was buying in 2019 so
1:36:27
might see some yeah just not much see what I mean two or three million I know they were just getting started Maybe
1:36:33
just not that much cash flow and then with this going on but that's the thing then they're still buying
1:36:41
and then they acquired some restaurants okay I just don't see the margin of safety
1:36:53
how much can I how much can a him and haul over a position you know what I mean and this would just be a super small position you know what I mean but
1:36:58
I'm trying to get acquainted with it and try to remember that way if everything does this is kind of what I'm doing if everything does
1:37:04
sell off crazily right then we're kind of prepared to buy and we kind of know the story this is what I was doing leading up to
1:37:11
um the recent sell-off on across all the stocks
1:37:18
but you look at the look at the Historical free capsule like you still earning a buck
1:37:24
can they get back look at that look at that 2010 to 2013 Range this is no joke they can get back there it doesn't seem
1:37:30
like it's a like uh it's gonna be easy but you get back to 150 million in revenues and you can get those simple
1:37:37
free cash flow margins up or that's the thing simple free cash flow was quite a bit higher than uh
1:37:46
they're starting off more cash than earnings looked like it was well run though
1:37:52
doesn't it was a pain in dividend no just pretty decently well run
1:37:57
and so if they get a everything back in line and if you get a
1:38:04
buck and free cash flow you could see 10 bucks that's the thing I can't it's harder five bucks
1:38:11
five bucks five bucks is tough three bucks I could
1:38:16
see three bucks
1:38:27
I don't know what to say it was trading this look at how I was trading I was just trading at 30 bucks what
1:38:35
what 30 bucks
1:38:46
how do you see 30 bucks here how do you see this
1:38:52
you don't you can't see 30 bucks you can't see it
1:38:58
efficient mark on my ass you see 20
1:39:04
you see 20 Max 25 absolute Max you can't see this give me a break
1:39:15
I could see this I could see this tent meet 10 to 15 maybe if they really turned things around this is the thing
1:39:21
there's always this possibility right you can't be so you can't be so close-minded in your analysis
1:39:26
um in theory any company can completely transform itself in into a whole nother Beast
1:39:33
um where barbecue Holdings could all of a sudden maybe the wings just start kicking ass they had some ingredient to it and all of a sudden people uh much
1:39:40
prefer their wings I'm pretty sure it's wings right I think over Buffalo Wild
1:39:45
Wings or whatever I don't care you need to there's always that possibility and if that happens forget about it the upside's taken care of you don't need to
1:39:51
worry about that it's a lot of times it's just navigating the downside getting through the the and then uh
1:39:57
to Kenya if you don't reach that that um Apex can you at least just earn some
1:40:03
relatively consistent free cash flow such that the market would price it in
1:40:08
in which case that's what I'd say 10 to 15 but I don't I don't like the risk that much but I'd add it add small I'd
1:40:16
add small let's keep an eye on it I mean how much time did I just waste is it wasted that's the thing none of this is
1:40:21
really wasted time for the sake of the stream it might be perceived as a waste of time hopefully you don't but uh not
1:40:26
for me this is good analysis for a company that could be quite a bit under uh probably remember she just had three
1:40:32
bucks just a couple of days ago damn it's just add three it's a different ball game at 320 than
1:40:40
it is at 460. that's the thing I was kind of I mentioned this but pissed about rfps always come back I was pissed
1:40:46
about this I was right there in three and then it's at 450 the week later I'm like are you kidding me
1:40:53
not these aren't comparable companies of course right but I'm just saying like when I got my my finger on the trigger
1:40:58
and then this happens I'm like what the hell okay all right let's keep going we got to check the charts today we have to because shits this is the time that we
1:41:05
have to do it I think we're all done looking inside our behind let's go let's go let's go let's go
1:41:10
sorry but you know what I do have to do right now is I gotta download the uh CSV I need to upload the
1:41:18
charts okay let's do this I'll do this quick what do I want to look I want to look at
1:41:23
the daily to be honest
1:41:29
RK portfolio that's right okay then download I'm gonna get it right this time I forget I messed it up at one
1:41:35
point download CSV okay portfolio
1:41:40
select all delete boom
1:41:47
upload CSV drag and drop not bad
1:41:52
20 seconds [Music]
1:41:59
that's sick I mean some busy work right but really that ain't
1:42:09
these old charts all right so okay let's let's start going through here you know but you know what I kind of want to check too is uh
1:42:15
I want to do the weekly as well
1:42:24
I want to see I want you do those charts look different Let Me Clear these
1:42:32
I'm gonna drop the same one in there right these are just tickers
1:42:38
the weekly is dictated by the chart I think this should be fine
1:42:48
pretty sure
1:43:01
seems wrong seems like a mistake check that out later who cares let's go
1:43:06
GameStop looks good wow how often do we say that I don't know you saw my you saw my you
1:43:13
saw the video I I think it looks good sorry just a quick I know we freaking started the stream by saying this but
1:43:18
like uh all right can I just toss a little bit of artwork on here
1:43:28
so silly
1:43:33
whatever yeah okay there's a line there's a lot
1:43:40
that's the thing ah who knows where this goes doesn't matter
1:43:45
it just doesn't look bad for me I usually think so but we do I do need GameStop to look good
1:43:51
in the near term future that's the thesis if you don't work out within nine months that's a problem
1:43:57
this looks bullish to me that's still nothing no defining uh it still looks like it's within it looks looks pretty
1:44:04
damn look at this
1:44:11
this is the candlesticks but if we're using the closes you know like you're like right there on
1:44:17
the closes you know what I mean you really need to break above six above seven
1:44:22
I think I don't know what's going through I'm a value investor what are you looking at me for I don't know your
1:44:28
guess is as good as mine I don't know it's going through the technical analysts mine I I I think it looks
1:44:34
bullish that's why I included in the video but with that I don't know I really I mean you need to break above
1:44:39
step once you break above seven though that's what I mean if they can just it's right there now at this point
1:44:46
that's forty percent forty percent ain't though
1:44:53
and then you go like this see like that bullish
1:44:59
that's so much bullish but uh don't look bad all right I think it I think it's gonna look better than the other charts
1:45:04
we're about to see for the rest of the uh portfolio look at this what the hell
1:45:10
what that is okay let's keep going RFP looks tremendous can we check out lumber
1:45:16
did I ever do this I don't think I did
1:45:21
look at this look at this it broke above it didn't it broke above eight I saw it I saw it or did we see it this is
1:45:28
the 21st didn't it oh maybe it was the futures
1:45:35
was it the future was it spot price that's chartered I don't remember
1:45:41
was Lumber oh there you go
1:45:47
what am I charting what is this spot
1:45:52
Lumber random length how often do you look at random Lanes I don't know what that is
1:46:00
oh random late Lumber maybe not like a two by four or something is that what that means I don't even know I don't
1:46:05
trade a number I don't know foreign
1:46:11
polish 8 30.
1:46:17
anyway you can kind of there you go I I want more RFP pull back to three come
1:46:23
back to three come come come I like it a lot more three than I do it
1:46:29
for and I I it's the second second position in the portfolio right it's it's a higher conviction play relatively
1:46:35
speaking but um on a relative basis I like it more three than I do it four because uh I could see
1:46:42
like 8 and 10 and 12. at four that gets tough but bullish CNR
1:46:50
holding up okay but not great I had added to it after the pop
1:46:57
it's kind of getting blocked by a resistance there but all the home builders crush it so let's see
1:47:02
toll oh
1:47:09
they're right there okay um well she got um
1:47:18
kbh good thing it popped up I already gotta see oh they're all bumping right up against there okay
1:47:24
hold the most speculative right there they're all kind of leveling off they're all right around there okay okay so is
1:47:29
the market all right right there everyone kind of banking on this pullback everyone banging on it
1:47:37
it just would be such a natural behavior especially if there's such a big fast run-up it's almost like everyone's
1:47:43
priced at an end so maybe it's not gonna happen this is what I mean it could go either way don't don't have high conviction in those types of predictions
1:47:48
don't do it to yourself just say this is what the books this is
1:47:53
what the books say could happen and um then that's it just watch
1:47:59
interesting home builders right up right up
1:48:04
it was yelling NPR is that the home builder yeah that's a home builder right
1:48:13
I just forget if I get the right thicker yeah residential construction
1:48:18
okay they're all right there keep going so CNR right there too not
1:48:24
surprising that it gets uh stopped
1:48:30
a good volume come down quite a bit but overbought this is bullish this is bullish see this super bullish right but
1:48:36
the whole home builders are are bullish so that's gonna be any surprise let's keep going new gold
1:48:41
we don't gold we don't need to keep looking at that what's cool doing sorry
1:48:48
nothing and sorry what's uh Bitcoin
1:49:04
oh it's right there I did it then I read that it went below 10K I didn't go below tickets right there it looks great
1:49:10
nothing looks bullish
1:49:16
TSC TSC holding up holding up but how about Oh Ellen
1:49:22
oh see we're doing the right thing wait wait wait wait wait
1:49:28
no rush on a while in we got it in the portfolio right
1:49:33
but let's um let's just sort by what do we want to sort by today
1:49:41
I don't know I forget how low it is 0.66 no rush we've been calling this for
1:49:49
a week based what on Strictly the chart fundamentals look decent but
1:49:57
look decent they don't look tremendous relative to the current price point but they look decent
1:50:03
but um there's no rush look at this this looks like with it in the context of everything
1:50:08
else it doesn't look that good at all so let's bear this one in mind but then you compare it to TSA
1:50:14
that's close awesome some here all right but we spent a long time on you BBQ
1:50:23
I mean this looks great TSC looks good but um what's the other there's like a
1:50:30
West something Lake what is it West
1:50:35
not West Rock isn't there like another Westlake chemical that's it that guy Taco that one looks good too
1:50:41
okay because I'm pretty sure that remember that guy on Seeking Alpha he was talking about you and Sayo I think he mentioned uh Wok Too this looks so
1:50:49
olm looks like bearish you know what I mean but um they pay in the dividend they get that
1:50:56
were they the one that like 130 plus a year there's something 80 years of dividends like I see that like all right
1:51:02
you really care that much about the dividend then I'm just gonna wait for you to pull back because you get your head stuck in the sand come on but this
1:51:07
one looks good okay so that doesn't look bad for the chemicals there and uh flow tech oh you see this big jump up sick
1:51:15
I'm pretty sure my average is about a buck this one I thought was a low risk
1:51:21
strong uh it's a relatively strong balance sheet this one's good this one looks good I don't know if I'll be out in here but uh posted The Insider buying
1:51:28
what's his name there pulled and this looks good good and that's an energy position too so
1:51:34
that's looking good and Tarot holding up well after the pullbacks [Music]
1:51:42
um in this bulge ball for rain for rrc too
1:51:49
you know what I mean they kind of go hand in hand like as long as these things are holding up okay oh it's so RC's is RC smaller than this now oh
1:51:56
yeah yeah yeah right oh it's right below is it the next chart
1:52:02
it's the next chart because I just trimmed it uh today a day a day late and a dollar short you know
1:52:08
or two days late I should have done it Wednesday and I just didn't
1:52:15
yeah it looks good nice I'm I'm pleased that antero's holding up though I am because I remember like we said natural
1:52:21
gas Trend still looks intact it just looks like a pullback for reasons that we felt we understood
1:52:27
um the bond issuance and so forth not a major huge concern a little bit of a
1:52:32
concern I don't mean it's it's meaningless I just mean let's see how let's see what it does after it but sometimes I I wait I you
1:52:40
get the pullback right and then I'll wait to see what it does but in this case I bought that day because I I
1:52:45
already explained my reasons but and now I'm that I did that I'm pleased it's holding up you know what I mean because I would have felt stupid if it like kept
1:52:52
on falling but I just thought we kind of knew why I pulled back and it seemed didn't it didn't deserve that much but now RC's
1:52:59
pulling back that's the thing RC's pump not that much it's noise what do we talk about can't even talk about that
1:53:06
okay keep going RC we got it oh it's right there that's noise but uh it's just been so
1:53:13
strong that it's it's a little bit odd to see it down a five percent day which is good those that's why those are good positions to to own and uh yeah
1:53:22
and if the multi-year trend is still intact which it is as of right now it still looks um oh you know who we can
1:53:29
look up on this now I'm a little bit curious did someone did um what's his name um
1:53:35
him him right there oh there we go did he comment on that pullback at all there's a couple other people who comment too
1:53:45
he's been bullish on the natural gas too I've kind of agreed with these other folks too this one's just readily
1:53:50
available um Casey his name's um damn I know his name
1:53:58
because he signed didn't he wtk sends his name I know it I'm sorry man I forget
1:54:06
well William coldis is that it something something coldest I remember
1:54:15
I don't know if I'm gonna see anything here I was just curious yeah that's okay there's some other folks too who I've
1:54:20
come across but I'll check this so they can't be checking up on this stuff all the time I'll go crazy I check up on whenever the
1:54:26
thought crosses my mind uh plus you see natural gas prices right
1:54:32
it's like okay boy I feel like it's been such a long time on natural gas pulling this up during the Stream
1:54:39
looks good 240.
1:54:44
all right bxc man this has been holding up really well huh nice I haven't trimmed I think I made a note to trim I
1:54:51
haven't trimmed maybe I think maybe I shouldn't how big is it there you go oh you know what I
1:54:56
should include in this in this particular chart I should include what the waiting is right now
1:55:01
but um oh does anyone own it we got time we're gonna do this today
1:55:07
okay we did this last Friday too maybe this is a Friday thing huh yeah maybe this is
1:55:12
a Friday thing we're not looking at the weeklies per se although I did just try to make it
1:55:17
but maybe this could be a weekend okay let's review everything see where we're at that could make sense
1:55:25
okay all right they didn't do anything anyone
1:55:30
else oh who's this who's this Jeffrey gendel all
1:55:36
want I don't recognize that name
1:55:46
punching Associates I don't recognize any of these names these are big jumps too
1:55:52
it's like a 40 jump 30 40 jump
1:55:57
is this position separate no probably not solo Allen Weber
1:56:03
uh another one of my men nice work Alan Weber I guess David Conan
1:56:09
could be grouped in with that I gotta say because of parts what is this again bxa
1:56:15
a lot of overlap with him yeah um let's just play it by ear okay so this was at June 30th where was the
1:56:21
trade on June 30th
1:56:27
7 8 it's still a cheap seven eight I think I may even add it around then now less much less cheap
1:56:33
I should probably trim this I said that before and I didn't do anything
1:56:39
just a little bit I'm not saying sell I'm not saying sell I'm just saying trimming a little bit
1:56:47
PBF yeah looks the same ain't nothing going on um
1:56:53
I want to add to this tell you that did no one buy this did we look this up
1:57:00
how did no one buy this in Q2
1:57:06
how could no one buy this even climate I mean if Carmen bought it I'd love that
1:57:11
but you didn't see this look at this Bari invests 36
1:57:19
percent of long I mean that's is that technically true I guess but then you
1:57:24
almost certainly Buy in March or April and he's just up huge or April rather and he's just up huge
1:57:31
that's probably that seems more likely to me so okay
1:57:39
slam Slim
1:57:45
that's all no one else Slim Shady yeah no no one really uh don't worry
1:57:51
there all right all right but this chart looks not that this chart looks like a chart for me that I should be adding on
1:57:57
and look at the RSI too this is the daily looks good looks like it should be out
1:58:02
but it's so I'm so heavy into it should I buy more
1:58:07
I need something I wish I had something else someone someone buy or something new Salman is anyone talking about it
1:58:16
I remember it's already the 10th it's already it's already position number ten you know what I mean it's like
1:58:21
for me to go like stronger than that I give me something give me something PBF
1:58:30
and the bonds are holding up well as I recall all right you know what let me just pull up the fundamentals there you go
1:58:37
sometimes uh when I say like I'll say like give me something just like a review of the fundamentals is like
1:58:43
there's myself then it sounds crazy okay let's keep going
1:58:53
maxar looks terrific I'm in 11 position 11th position but I
1:58:58
still feel as though I should have had more should have been adding right here no no real excuse damn could have had another
1:59:06
70 on that
1:59:12
did Barry even have that this time he probably sold out still
1:59:19
looks bullish though all right sandwich pull them back added let's keep watching it
1:59:26
there's not gonna be much that might it's probably going to be a quiet build but we know enough about the story
1:59:33
to be like Adam the pullbacks Let's Build It Up I think I don't think can you imagine
1:59:39
Carl messing this up Maybe I wouldn't bet on that though
1:59:47
I mean he may be at the whim of um Energy prices right that's fair but if
1:59:52
but if energy turns around or energy is in favor again it's gonna crush it I would think
1:59:58
then the ball then he's then it's going to do well so Adam pullbacks I guess I guess that's what I'm gonna do
2:00:05
how big am I going to make that position though you know didn't the balance sheet look good yeah
2:00:10
the balance should look real good and that is the next quarterly as the next quarterly earnings release we're gonna get when that our confirmation that they
2:00:17
they sold that building and they have enough cash to cover dead or maybe they even paid it off and then it's going to be up you know like
2:00:23
with some of these companies you reach a point I feel like I'm not to keep pulling back to GameStop but you reach that point where it's it's almost almost
2:00:30
gonna be positive news from here on out until um the thesis
2:00:36
excuse me unfolds as expected I'm not saying sandwich is there yet but if you've if they end up wiping out they're
2:00:42
dead if they end up wiping out they're dead um
2:00:47
well that's the thing it's such a cyclical industry that um if Energy prices collapse then it's going to
2:00:52
collapse too so that's the thing yeah it's it's kind of hard to go super heavy into these be done all right that's a little bit a
2:00:59
little bit better that's a little bit um negative right that's quite the drop too look at these
2:01:05
couple days look at that thanks let's bear this one on mine let's
2:01:12
bear this uh just it's just a day
2:01:19
wow all right we need to pay attention to this as we keep going
2:01:29
never even got over 50 on the r side this is just P10 I know I'm just saying this is bearish too got overbought in
2:01:35
early June not quite get overbought not that we're trying to this is the daily not that we're trying to play monthly
2:01:41
weekly moves or anything like that but
2:01:47
if the market was selling off you know what the Market's not selling off though
2:01:59
and oil's holding up but sometimes the equities can can can lead we'll keep an
2:02:04
eye on this let's see like if oil prices start heading south and uh the commodity started heading south even the Market's
2:02:10
holding up well we're at all-time highs right right there huh
2:02:15
yowzers huh right there what do you do with that
2:02:23
I'll take it out yet not yet just nothing going to August right no one's doing anything it's August let's
2:02:29
see what happens in September October let's kind of shape it up I don't know if people have been talking about this but like so quiet in August right and
2:02:35
we're right there at the resistance and all-time house blah blah blah but like September October can be tough times to
2:02:42
the market like it wouldn't that be uh this is not a prediction right this is this is what the Talking Heads talk
2:02:48
about this right um wouldn't it be a natural move for the market to just pull back during that
2:02:53
time right and press election year blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
2:03:00
it's materials doing what's energy doing let's let's just jump right to it you know what I mean
2:03:05
okay so this is XLE a pullback but nothing alarming there's
2:03:12
nothing alarming here yet you know what I like to look at too is XCS let's just nip this right on the button
2:03:18
because we just saw P10 and I know I saw some other ones so there you go so this is equipment and
2:03:23
services if this is leading something for us to keep an eye on right here okay there you go this let's we jump
2:03:31
right to the ETF so we don't even need to pin this on P10 right this is what I mean we jump right to it don't even waste our time
2:03:37
we're going to see some other ones that are somewhat negative and sorry let me just see materials one more
2:03:43
time looks fine and uh Industrials I suggested is it Just Energy
2:03:50
yep and is it just uh I guess I'm less concerned especially because oil prices will hold up let's see what happens this
2:03:55
is a test let's see if oil prices follow suit early next week or next week and um
2:04:01
or even other Industries I don't care but at least we just nipped that right in the bud
2:04:07
we're going to see this across all the energy names
2:04:12
what's what are the other I have other ones I have other um
2:04:17
right here I got EMP
2:04:23
op it doesn't look that bad it looks bad on that damn trend line but uh
2:04:28
don't don't get obsessed with these long-term trend lines even I know that and I'm an idiot
2:04:35
I mean like just go like this and stuff it looks fine couple more days it looks okay
2:04:43
if you're day trading stuff you care about these small things I don't really care that much I see that we see this blah blah blah
2:04:50
this is the same chart this is XCS again so you see this this is what we just turned right but then you do
2:04:59
here we are from May and it looks okay it's
2:05:05
um I'll keep my eye on it now but I don't see anything like I'm freaking out about right
2:05:11
oil services here we go I like to look at take a peek at all I forget all the differences it's not the same temperatures I'm glad we pulled this up
2:05:17
right off the bat huh we don't need to waste our time with all the other damn energy charts it's the same we're seeing it across the board
2:05:24
um get some good headlines
2:05:33
did crude slip is it me or did it oil lifted but that was August 17th by
2:05:38
shrunk see what I mean oil lifted by strong OPEC plus compliance with cuts and then boom couple days later names add to
2:05:45
weeks losses Okay blah blah blah wait a second this guy
2:05:53
he sounds familiar did he ever
2:05:59
oh he's writing a ton of articles
2:06:13
I'm going off on a tangent now right I thought I recognize this guy's name from uh um whatever it doesn't matter
2:06:22
sorry all right let me just see this what we got here is today's weakest performers
2:06:27
the growth sensitive group continues to struggle this week with a with a nearly five percent loss since Friday yep
2:06:34
Saudi energy Minister says Global dementia recovered a pre-dem predependental gloves as soon as Q for a
2:06:40
while but a draft all right nothing now keep moving
2:06:49
pump now good this is good we don't need to spend too much time we're going to see the same damn chart across the board still looks fine and I'll add if it gets
2:06:56
cheap enough did anyone buy this this is good now let's do this today
2:07:01
anyone buy this last quarter now we know what the quarterly Reports
2:07:07
look like no no probably too much uncertainty
2:07:15
Omi holding up let me oh hold it up inside of buy they
2:07:23
were kind of trimming a bit weren't they
2:07:32
not the next mathenics
2:07:41
nada NADA NADA okay
2:07:47
Alcoa looks good
2:07:52
energy I was gonna say you see that big red that I'm like oh that's a big drop energy
2:07:58
nothing new though did anyone buy this one I feel like people should have
2:08:06
anyone Bueller Bueller
2:08:12
no one by alone am I crazy
2:08:17
there's many reasons that funds wouldn't buy into a stock you know what I mean I just think ah
2:08:23
a little bit of support here a little bit of support people holding up
2:08:34
hat boy scary flat huh cheers looks good all right now now we're
2:08:40
making cvgi pullback we need what we want some more
2:08:46
Circ I don't know you know oh I think I did trim this a little bit the other day
2:08:52
that's probably after the pullback damn but um just to it's just raising just a like a fract like 15 of it or something
2:09:00
I've already trimmed so much and actually I'm just I'm on my way out at this point and I also saw the other one that we
2:09:06
talked about I sold um I sold HSC most like um everything but a
2:09:13
couple I don't think I bought NGS
2:09:18
I don't think I did that what did it do if it didn't pull back take it yeah pull back good
2:09:24
good decision I thought I'd just wait oh that turned out to be good because I
2:09:29
like it at eight it could come back it could come back lower like I said for the same reason it took
2:09:35
so long for it to take off I could come back I could keep coming
2:09:42
a little and by not buying on some by not buying it's a midi hedge on natural gas prices right sounds silly but
2:09:49
I know I shouldn't I should Implement more shorting I know
2:09:58
would be set though oh
2:10:04
I didn't buy that's okay
2:10:10
all right let's keep going Beezer oh nice that looks good sick
2:10:18
that looks real good that looks better than the rest doesn't
2:10:24
it don't we just look at a whole bunch of these and I didn't look at Beezer oh that looks good I guess okay
2:10:30
this is the thing can I just pull up my damn watch this let's get right to it
2:10:35
watch this boom I think it's under my discretionary boom
2:10:41
I say Cirque
2:10:51
consumer discretionary home builders looks terrific Lumber oh look I include Lumber I'll
2:10:58
include a lumber right in my uh this Home Building
2:11:04
nice oh God I did that home construction bullish crazy bullish homebuilders bullish so you see it
2:11:11
across the board so okay so but I what I was curious about was you saw BCS look at bzh looking really good but look at
2:11:17
d8 uh Horton looks really good oh so they were all up today a bit but seeing I wasn't up today was it
2:11:26
flat 1R NVR
2:11:32
is still intact what are you gonna do I did there was a there was a an
2:11:37
announcement today on uh on homes existing homes or something that it crushed it I guess it's no
2:11:44
surprise I get the gist of it I just I was wondering if there was something sticking out about bzh ufi kind of
2:11:50
pulling back a bit flat nothing super bearish oh I'm kind of I was one I'm not relieved but I was gonna
2:11:55
say we checked out a couple charts pretty early on in the Stream and I'm like oh is everything starting to turn but it looks like it's Just Energy
2:12:02
it's fine silver fine MHO Home Building same
2:12:09
right up against the resistance but we saw enough bullish in something else here we go on Mac I still didn't look into it I know we made that out look
2:12:15
into Mac look into Mac make it again when am I gonna do it I'm no expert on retail REITs uh make no
2:12:22
mistake anyone talk about it
2:12:30
let's pull it up too in the fundamentals just as a reminder you know
2:12:38
oh we got oilin in here oh we got tapestry in here too all right
2:12:45
we're gonna look up let's look on Mac in the meantime can I look up tapestry real quick number six
2:13:00
note to self look up the tab before you and input the ticker
2:13:06
it still doesn't seem like that should have happened
2:13:12
right why this happened if I if I adjust this ticker right here
2:13:18
what the hell does this ticker have anything to do with it doesn't that's dumb look at it pulls it in right from there
2:13:24
takes A6 doesn't make any sense
2:13:29
um yeah this is a good size couple oh that's a big chop off that was from six point to five billion damn
2:13:38
it's not that cheap let's see tangible book forget about it so you're losing some margin of safety there what about
2:13:44
what are we doing on margins Revenue sizable company gross margins declining ah look at this
2:13:51
been tough high 70s to Mid 60s that's tough that's
2:13:56
tough that's on the average three year average
2:14:03
Ah that's tough that's gross margin too I don't know what to say or how about net margin it would always
2:14:08
stuck out with um coach is the high net margins this is no joke
2:14:13
fifteen twenty percent
2:14:18
I mean well the 10 years the 10 years leading up to when I said I was looking at it it was like it was those net
2:14:24
margins that caught my attention as they cut a lot of people's attention right remember thinking that's a serious
2:14:30
um you know like Coach bags and stuff right and growing up um I remember my mother talking about like Coach bags uh
2:14:36
really nice and like really fancy type stuff and um in my head I don't know if other people think like that too but
2:14:43
remember thinking like oh coach is really fancy and stuff and that kind of explained their fat net margins of uh
2:14:50
if you have that brand name recognition you can kind of charge blah blah blah blah blah um Quality stuff but now you can see it
2:14:56
coming back those networks is coming down which is it inevitable with any any industry but um
2:15:03
down to 10 percent I mean these are almost certainly breakdowns what about
2:15:09
the operating cash flow you've seen an operating cash flow too that down to 13 now not a good Trend not
2:15:16
a good trend not a good Trend and this is the thing and so you see these retailers or even
2:15:22
retailers are or apparel apparel and accessories and stuff with brand names and everything
2:15:28
like that unless you can um now that's the thing these have been like something like coach has been
2:15:34
around so long it's not so much a fad but um you need to remain relevant um
2:15:39
and they don't have really many catalysts as compared to like a GameStop just use another comparison so many damn
2:15:46
GameStop comparisons um where without the upcoming console cycle like if the car if like if no
2:15:53
consoles were going to be released for a couple years like that's it like there's no real Catalyst for something like coach and whatever it's conceivable they
2:16:00
could have some big huge win for like a bag or whatever it is but that's tough and then you got something
2:16:06
like um sketches though like I've talked about Skechers before and um well run like
2:16:11
code look you look at this purple and green this is historically a well-run business part of that is this those fat net margins and growing revenues
2:16:19
and um they had been paying a dividend oh wow they're still paying a dividend the price is 15 bucks wow
2:16:28
oh that ain't bad wow for so long it was 30 uh it's just
2:16:36
this long grind lower oh no you know what I'd really like it below
2:16:42
10. look at that
2:16:47
uh wow 15 for a tap yeah look what this is what I this is what you see the purple and green is compelling but um
2:16:55
they need to like bottom out you know what I mean look at this big drop off and revenues
2:17:01
almost 20 percent gross Mars declining that Mars declining
2:17:08
simple free cash flow a buck it's not cheap enough ah
2:17:15
we're like we could be like in the early stages of Aurora Kitty investment here I'm not I'm not gonna buy it now but um
2:17:23
this is like stage one oh though I thought stay joined would have been a couple years ago
2:17:28
and it never quite got cheap enough I don't know what to say like right now you're even like oh yeah well it's cheaper now but um
2:17:35
but the circumstances have changed from five years ago you know and now it's not that cheap
2:17:43
but they earned two bucks last year but the trend it's about future earnings it's about the future
2:17:51
a buck wow tapestry
2:17:57
okay let's keep going I'm always gonna look up Mac we got time right 9 20. oh we got
2:18:02
to keep going 120 okay we're good
2:18:11
ad hoc what the hell
2:18:25
oh it is in here those balls threw me off okay
2:18:31
okay okay let's get some Revenue boost support revenues pulled back a bit gross margin boom still holding steady
2:18:39
through June 30th not bad not bad I know it's a Reit but still
2:18:45
um Relic Rogue drop down how about cash Relic roughly
2:18:51
still positive at three are average though
2:18:57
I don't even have it for uh I don't have it for one off year interesting probably should
2:19:04
okay cash flow ebit adjusted everything's still positive for now but
2:19:09
that could turn that could turn look at these net margins not bad on the net margin front huh but I think I mean
2:19:15
you tend to see fatternet margins for um these REITs all right what are we gonna get to here
2:19:22
oh look at the purple and green huh purple green purple green purple green
2:19:28
is that what is Khalifa what's Wiz Khalifa right
2:19:34
I like the purple and green
2:19:41
look at those look at that dividend huh I mean this dividend they really pay two dollars in dividend over the past 12
2:19:47
months on a seven dollar share price what are the Insiders doing damn
2:19:52
they're not doing anything since March right all right and how about um
2:19:59
anyone do anything here is this yep
2:20:04
we looked this up recently nothing NADA no one touched it not great not great
2:20:09
sometimes insiders Get It Wrong by the way make make no mistake about it
2:20:18
I like I I just really like how purple and green is
2:20:24
I'm gonna tailed off even before this all happened look at 2018 no purple and green
2:20:29
20 2019 no purple and green and just a reminder this is uh three year and five year book measured
2:20:37
Roe so um on a three-year basis that was starting to tail off and it wasn't due to I don't
2:20:44
have it adjusted for share or purchases it's kind of difficult with the data that I have but um there weren't many
2:20:51
share purchases a little bit though not much 148 to 141
2:20:59
and then they issued earnings kind of tapered off
2:21:07
ering cash flow symbol free cash flow buck I mean it's a read so you handle reads differently what's the market cap
2:21:15
1.1 hmm
2:21:22
anyone say anything about it Roberts persons
2:21:31
oh yeah passive invest oh yeah was this recently did they report this at quarter rent oh we didn't know anything about that was such a weird
2:21:38
if anyone know his last good move that may have been made from passive yeah this is me anyone know what they
2:21:46
would know who who they are or what they do are they any good quite active for a passive investment
2:22:00
yeah SPG looks interesting but I kind of like gigantic
2:22:11
what's this a fortune teller
2:22:16
did you want to ask oh is that was this something from the 13 day from April
2:22:22
the board agreed to Grant a limited waiver which authorizes NYSC to
2:22:27
beneficially own up to nine ten percent
2:22:36
okay just curious
2:22:42
uh which which in rate of changes if change terms are the worst in the company's history okay well that's going
2:22:48
to be the case for a lot of companies in Q2
2:22:54
however the Market's reaction has been neutral all right that's kind of bullish in my mind
2:22:59
the market already priced in a lot right there's no increase in the stock price all right let's it's tough to get into when you start describing what the stock
2:23:05
price is doing like it's tough and the long-term Mac is a sound bet because the underlying value that is
2:23:12
much higher that's what I thought too but I don't know what I'm talking about but he's neutral isn't he's neutral but
2:23:18
he thinks the value is much higher interesting
2:23:33
um I said earlier elegant now but in the meantime now for good some good reasons why investors could be positive the
2:23:38
reason why the stock is not plunged a lot is that the market is already in right um
2:23:44
there's a buy for long truly long-term investors hi everyone Max on background it shows
2:23:50
they only have oh geez okay um anyone in here that I recognize I don't know any of these people
2:23:56
I don't know
2:24:02
they got Pawns oh
2:24:08
how much do I dig in I don't know how much I dig in for this
2:24:17
not sure it's worth it no come on
2:24:26
all right let's forget it
2:24:33
we'll keep moving
2:24:39
sdkl that one's still looking good I've had this for for a while on yeah I
2:24:45
regret not adding more down here just I was diversifying I guess I don't
2:24:51
know okay ovv looking good still oh I got those I
2:24:59
got I still got some calls that I need to be but it's tracking energy right so I got to be careful
2:25:04
if that's had himself managed accordingly but still looks the same child centers
2:25:11
all right this one looks good you don't want I could use a restroom super quick you know what I just realized is I don't have a uh what I should have is like a
2:25:19
like a um like a quick video or something to put on I could what I should do is I could
2:25:24
put I could mix all though I mean you probably see the damn roaring Kitty videos a bunch I play them all at the beginning and the outro and stuff but I
2:25:30
should at least put those videos together to play um that's like a break or something anyway I thought about it I should have
2:25:39
I haven't done OBS in like a couple of months I've been focusing on like some videos and the templates and stuff
2:25:44
um but I could probably add some more stuff to OBS on that front I'll give that some thought anyway I'll be right back I'll be right I'll be
2:25:50
right back in like two minutes you know what I can do is I can do the countdown again and then I'll go to the opening I apologize I know I played it at the
2:25:56
beginning but I guess that's all I got right here just so you get something to watch I'll be right back give me two minutes okay one sec
2:27:06
[Music]
2:27:22
okay y'all [Music]
2:27:27
foreign [Music]
2:28:22
[Music]
2:28:35
oh I got back just in time holy
2:28:42
that was incredible timing so I got to figure out how long that how long that lasts because that's a good length uh
2:28:49
for whatever video I can put together that's incredible okay let's keep going I apologize thank
2:28:54
you for let me take a quick break all right let's keep moving Travel Centers this one
2:29:00
this is what I've mentioned this before there's a lot of Leverage 250 million market cap now
2:29:07
flat look at this oh not doing much
2:29:16
damn is it time to trim this one's tough this one's tough to
2:29:22
value and everything like that I need to see I want to see some action
2:29:27
on this one um we're not going to see any buy minimal buying not for a while yeah I did see he
2:29:34
saw some back in March but not much
2:29:45
cash is trash except in a pandemic what is this
2:29:55
damn sounds do I remember this from t
2:30:03
I think it was something else something else we crossed past what's on
2:30:12
maybe a big five you know that was a missed opportunity damn I can't remember oh Colorado
2:30:19
textile hey that's the one that's the small maybe it was ta
2:30:26
all right there's some overlap with this dude I see some of the same names that you've
2:30:31
seen on the wrong Kitty portfolio this is from 2020.
2:30:37
who commented on this Blue Streak
2:30:47
um oh yeah yeah he was invested here the
2:30:53
next 12 months the stock is inherently rolled expecting it to just sit here yeah I remember him
2:30:59
was this and dropping to new lows is also extremely like his business is actually fairly stable at the cheapest valuation it's ever been yep so I
2:31:05
potential here is extraordinary just on a reversion of me and I see 16 and 20 yep that was that was good I agree with that now we're there though you know
2:31:11
what I mean and if the new Co proves to be real could be a five Bankers I kind of agree with this
2:31:18
but um you need you need some stuff to go right where are we at 50.
2:31:27
I was surprised how cheap it didn't get I think I was buying right here but like between like seven and nine
2:31:35
I remember thinking like how does this how is it not getting cheaper I kind of just expected it to get even cheaper you know
2:31:41
but it was like right there I like held off like because it appeared as though it's so damn cheap you know
2:31:47
what I mean now could run up I don't know we'll see
2:31:52
I don't know if I feel what is that oh it's split
2:31:57
I don't know if I'd be added to that I'm not adding to this let's watch let's do nothing you want to
2:32:04
do nothing I do I do I do great at doing nothing where is this oh this whole building
2:32:10
okay what am I doing back to the portfolio Travel Centers okay we're at 9 30. oh we gotta keep we gotta
2:32:17
make it through fossil oh fossil holding up after that bit up should have added to that at those lows I knew to add it
2:32:23
that foreign
2:32:30
Soul subform you know what I mean like that should have been added to right now right now it's the 31st position I'm a
2:32:37
gigantic amount I wish I could see how what percentage it is in the portfolio
2:32:44
but that quick bit up and we don't even know why I don't think there's any um announcement right
2:32:50
beginning of August got anything I don't think so
2:33:01
yeah I'm August 12th Beats Beats by a dollar forty three holy
2:33:06
weren't they buying until there's been some sneaky Insider buying here that no one was talking about like a good amount
2:33:11
check this yeah oh it was back in June look at that seven hundred thousand
2:33:17
dollars June 9th and that same the same guy bought another 150 000.
2:33:23
and a March that's that's good Insider buying now what we should do is who is this Gregory
2:33:32
go down too many pets I want to get through these charts I don't want to
2:33:42
maybe a hush baby Wikipedia always down there should have kept going
2:33:48
he's the exact VP Chief commercial officer
2:33:53
not nothing Wikipedia
2:34:02
nope not him all right whatever check it out later but just keep our eye on her now
2:34:10
keep it going NGS eyes on him we just looked at that
2:34:19
um I'll say it again cve I could see Trim in this
2:34:26
I'm gonna trim this they're not buying anything are they what's the point I got so much energy
2:34:33
exposure plus I'm like adding it in different ways you know what I mean what's the uh this is it right nope that's not it this is it
2:34:45
unless they're buying with Truman I think we just looked the other day but you never know oh
2:34:53
oh they did that same person Keith mcphail
2:34:59
100 000. no that was April six it's only him by himself
2:35:05
though they bought a ton in March if you recall that was a big reason it was a it was a big position and I had some calls
2:35:12
on it too well 500k that's no joke
2:35:32
I don't know I feel like the upside's kind of limited on this I can look it up but uh
2:35:44
position was it right there pull that up all right let's keep going
2:35:49
grayscale Bitcoin holding up okay XCS oh XTC I'm gonna say I'm gonna
2:35:59
what was this one I got this one too these are these are like higher quality what's the market cap on cve
2:36:08
they're too big I mean I yeah there's a case to be made if you
2:36:14
wanted to minimize risk and you uh get some of the larger ones but I don't care I
2:36:20
I'd rather just deal on some smaller ones and uh have some utilize some stop losses or something
2:36:29
sgms holding up okay spr not I mean holding up but yeah I
2:36:37
mean this mimics Airlines right not doing anything
2:36:43
do I get Airlines here oh damn
2:36:51
well it could be a buying opportunity I wish no one's doing anything with it all
2:36:56
right keep going oh did anyone buy this
2:37:06
no I don't bought it all right keep going vsat all right we know this from Karma
2:37:11
no big deal nothing even pay attention revolve oh coming back okay
2:37:17
I might buy I might buy I want to pull back to 15.
2:37:26
I kind of like it I um 39. if we get time I'll pull that up take a
2:37:32
peek at those fundamentals been a while I mean I actually didn't know about it until um that Insider buying and um
2:37:39
was it early March we said Ryder it was early March I think like a good
2:37:44
chunk of change million plus and um and I was excited about it
2:37:50
and now it's it I I bought and it wasn't a huge position only because I felt it didn't get that cheap and now it's
2:37:56
tripled um but still I would I wanted at like five I'm like can you get to five and like bottom out but the reason is that's
2:38:03
the thing it's hard for some of these to get even cheaper because they're not that leveraged and they have they're a growth story that's the thing as I
2:38:10
recall revolve was uh is a growth company and I remember thinking oh this is sick if I'd
2:38:15
only get a little bit cheaper but the thing is those things aren't going to get that cheap so you kind of just accept that the best you're gonna get is
2:38:20
maybe a double or a triple and you would you appreciate it because how else would you get exposure to those
2:38:26
along these lines I want to try and get through these charts but I been reading how some people in the big March in
2:38:31
April pull back how they um how they use it as an opportunity to buy into
2:38:37
higher quality companies and I just think yeah I guess but uh here I am I'm
2:38:43
like taking the opposite side you've seen me critique some of my own March and April efforts like I've I've done
2:38:49
well but like I feel like I should have done even better picking up some more of those five and ten Baggers like I wish I
2:38:54
went more into the doctor I wish I went more into the shittier companies and I find it interesting that people were like oh yeah no I I use this opportunity
2:39:01
to get into the higher quality ones and I think who care I mean I it's everyone has their own different style I'm not critiquing other anyone else's style
2:39:07
it's whatever works best and like I even said maybe five ten years down the line I look back at my own style and be like what was I doing maybe it wasn't worth
2:39:13
it but for now as a matter of maximizing rates of return I think those are the
2:39:19
times you gotta do you gotta be buying those more spec ones I don't know anyway just
2:39:25
okay let's keep going anyway our vlv was one of the less speculative ones but that's the thing I came across and I'm
2:39:31
like this one came across the uh the desk there we go let's take a peek and uh whatever OLN looks like terrific
2:39:38
keep coming back keep coming back cut your damn dividend and then let's let's go heavy
2:39:44
um I mean this is CL this is coming back there's nothing I do right here this has been sick when did we say this
2:39:50
Monday and it's like look at this it's working out damn charts damn charts
2:39:56
gotta keep going okay DBI all right DBI just kind of flat looking good a lot it's number 42.
2:40:08
it's low doesn't it
2:40:18
and Bart didn't Bari still have it Barry copy of my style Larry get your
2:40:23
own stocks kid
2:40:30
I mean I like this guy I like this guy having a heavy position
2:40:39
yeah you still got some small but uh he's got it I feel like I should add to DBI no
2:40:48
I just added to it I did take believe me believe me I added to it but I go small I I take my time
2:40:56
I take my time on these
2:41:02
just this week was it this week my wife said she wanted to take she's gonna go check out DSW I
2:41:08
could have sworn she said that okay CPS yeah this is interesting
2:41:15
this one could have like quite a bit of upside they don't buy this but it looks like uh
2:41:21
look at the fundamentals uh look at the fundamentals and I'm surprised it it traded is so as highly as it did
2:41:32
942 come on come on come on come on oh what's this value investor Clifford sosin as the top
2:41:38
Holdings oh it's like everyone knew it was a running investor except for me oh I knew he was a valley investor I just
2:41:44
don't know it's credit expertise he's being reported on oh it's embarrassing
2:41:52
where are we so CPS no one really owns this no one did and no one does
2:41:59
I still don't understand how a trailer decided it did it must have had some
2:42:05
must have had something interesting no one's buying an e there I mean I don't know the fundamentals up
2:42:11
but take my word for it 120 bucks 150 bucks was crazy for whatever I had to try to pull it up
2:42:18
let's keep going keep going keep going wprt holding up
2:42:24
I don't want to add to this but uh
2:42:30
that's the thing we should if this is a weekly this would be much easier if this were a weekly thing because like wprt I
2:42:36
might add on like a pullback to a buck or something but I wanna I don't want to write that I don't want to write that every damn time
2:42:42
for every company like I add to this it's more it's probably much more important to just look at it so if I get quicker at scrolling through during the
2:42:48
stream and stuff eqt looks good looks like rrc everything looks solid which looks even better
2:42:54
about AR makes me want to add more to AR you know you need to give it more time though this it's too soon it's been three days
2:43:01
in this downturn nothing Twi cut hey I've fallen asleep remember how
2:43:07
I remember how I said during the stream like cvgi and Twi kind of group them together on my head here they are following the same Trend I should have
2:43:13
added to TWI I haven't seen enough to add to TWI I don't know I'm less so-so
2:43:18
about this one damn this one kept on going up huh whatever kid
2:43:29
whatever I'm not buying a 12. whatever gii oh didn't I say buy back more 10.
2:43:40
no this one
2:43:50
maybe that was ufi and check out giova all right it's getting interesting though
2:43:57
all right so it's 48th percent it's not that I mean it's not much has changed but I'd like to dabble a little bit
2:44:04
it wasn't anybody oh
2:44:10
I thought he had bought since April okay good to know and no one bottle spot right he's got control of it so it won't
2:44:16
surprise me if people kind of just steer clear you know what I mean when someone's got control of it I know I
2:44:21
said that before
2:44:27
I feel like it might be as a company that owns it too whatever keep going keep going keep going I'm not going to
2:44:33
say anything right now
2:44:46
I'm going to say it again I'm going to say the same damn note and I I definitely did just that but I
2:44:51
had it small fly Leasing I could see it I could I
2:44:56
could see out into this this looks bearish though huh this is kind of tracking energy that's
2:45:02
interesting this is like the first one we've seen that kind of looks like energy If he if I didn't see this I would think energy
2:45:08
yikes we saw his PR we saw what about Delta or something
2:45:16
okay Carnival similar what about uh some uh
2:45:30
that was holding up better um
2:45:36
I could see added to this cut am I why couldn't I it's not a great business
2:45:42
I never go heavy well I don't think I'd go heavy
2:45:50
we gotta keep going I'm on our top we're 50. okay this one looks interesting should I add to this
2:45:57
did anyone buy this got solid cash flow didn't Bill Miller get involved with this
2:46:03
and like his personal trust or something yeah there you go William Miller that's him ain't it yeah February 20th he did
2:46:10
it like right before I was like dialed into that at the time I'm like oh okay I'm pretty sure it says like his
2:46:15
personal trust or something if you pull up the footnotes oh there it is Miller value Partners oh he Miller value
2:46:21
Partners reduced their position
2:46:27
this quarter no one else though damn
2:46:32
family controlled and stuff uh looks okay though
2:46:38
I remember seeing it at two dollars right there that day I remember seeing it that day I saw a lot of stuff that day because I
2:46:45
remember thinking a lot of this stuff is super cheap and I wasn't I wasn't at the time it wasn't clear to me that many
2:46:51
things were just retesting you can see some things took out their lows this is what I mean some things took out their lows from March 18th and March 23rd or
2:46:58
whatever many of them were just retesting though but there still could be some upside I
2:47:04
wish I could see some something going on
2:47:09
this is gonna just probably it's either it's either over it's gonna explode that Bill Miller's dabble on and it's bullish
2:47:15
for me makes me think it's not over you know what I mean like if it were over no one
2:47:21
wouldn't be dealing on this this looks like by the way
2:47:33
it's got cash flow but super debt super super leveraged that's all you need to know that's the story
2:47:38
that's the story Morning Glory let me tell you HOV Hove H to the Izzo
2:47:46
homebuilder keep going 10 minutes 10 minutes West digital oh this is playing out so we bought that
2:47:54
position right so this is why it's the 50 you know why I like where's the digital and bluish blah blah blah but that chart when I added that day I'm
2:47:59
like this is Paris though took out these lows now let's keep on watching we probably even have a note
2:48:05
sick this is what I'm talking about the charts the charts
2:48:11
follow-up on acquisition and 27 Oh follow up follow up as in like uh here we go watch
2:48:18
WDC at 36 right there we know this is why it's such a small position
2:48:23
even though I'm super and it's a big company and I'm super well it's barely come back what am I talking about it's
2:48:29
only three bucks it's like 10 percent but for a company the size of Western Digital I feel like that's big and um
2:48:34
now let's keep watching them I'll keep adding to this this is great
2:48:41
this is great
2:48:48
I'll keep adding It's Gonna Keep Going Down
2:48:55
this looks bad now this is tracking energy flr is tracking energy
2:49:04
could be an ad uh we're not going to get to the fundamentals but uh maybe I'll just keep these up maybe I'll
2:49:10
check it this weekend I know that's the thing something I mean right now we've been going up against the
2:49:15
three-hour stream every single time which is I guess is good but sometimes I uh sometimes you need more sometimes when I'm actually doing work I need I
2:49:21
need six hours eight hours 12 hours um and then sometimes I don't feel like doing it that's why it's tough to figure
2:49:27
out the timing on the stream but this I'm pretty sure is like low downside this is what I was so surprised I was so
2:49:32
surprised it sold off as much as it did it was a bigger position and I'm like how am I how am I getting hit this hard
2:49:38
mind I mean it bounced back in days right one two three it was three days
2:49:44
but I remember thinking how is this at three dollars right now because I I wish I went heavier
2:49:51
obviously I wish it went heavier because it I was like what what the hell and I don't think I could get many options on
2:49:57
I probably looked at options on it but um I feel the opposite the downside someone Limited
2:50:10
this one I would add to um
2:50:16
this used to be much bigger I've been trimming this so the flr used to be a much bigger position but I've been
2:50:21
trimming I guess I think I guess I've been doing a good job it started it starts started looking more bearish than
2:50:26
others so right around here and like everything else was still cranking this was a top 10 because this is like a top
2:50:32
five nah top ten position now it's 53 like I um I'm kind of surprised to see
2:50:37
it this low because I was like I said I was super bullish on it and uh like I felt the downside was so minimal and it
2:50:43
was definitely a top 10 position but I want to say it was top five position and um and it it crushed it and I guess I it
2:50:50
turned out in this case I did a good job of trimming early and trimming quickly like a lot of these positions I've been
2:50:56
turning out of you still see Camping World that's because it went up so much I've trimmed it a ton and it's still a
2:51:01
top 15 position but flr pretty much tripled and now it's a 53rd
2:51:09
position after trimming but now I'm like maybe I should start adding but who knows this could fall back with energy
2:51:16
did anyone buy this oh
2:51:24
yeah that company I looked into that company when they took their position March 2020 I looked into them
2:51:33
no one really though no oh toe would told you toll added nice not a huge position this is still
2:51:40
but uh they added I like that who knows when but as of June 30th
2:51:46
they get styled they get taste what can I say
2:51:53
it's good okay otgi otgi oh we definitely pulled up those fundamentals and uh I never got to
2:52:00
them rest assured even if I did I wouldn't know what the hell to make of them it's tough to Value all right so this
2:52:07
one looks looks not that great but at the same time it could be an ad you know what I mean
2:52:13
but um and these aren't these aren't super bullish charts but I'm adding just if they're small positions it's a all
2:52:20
right flexshopper we just added to that I made I doubt it it's only 55th I I doubled the position I doubled it
2:52:30
I'd add again let's give it a little bit of time but
2:52:35
uh my dad again CeCe another home builder
2:52:40
it's time to start like I got someone so these are after major trimming but CCS
2:52:46
was another huge winner four bagger here and these are kind of big now they are they were like 300 400 back in the day
2:52:52
which was perfect Viking yeah biotech new home another home builder could have some up some up
2:52:59
room so much home see all these home builders major Eagle same as Viking was it at 105
2:53:05
yeah toll
2:53:10
same VR TV on yeah this this one too this
2:53:15
one's kind of like a lot of cash flow but risky and uh but even more so their business model might be going
2:53:23
what are they got vrtv the Carmen's involved with this one is he still involved with it he's got like a good chunk of it too
2:53:30
when I saw he was involved with it I'm like all right that cash was good Bob post they still owns 22 that alone
2:53:37
good enough for me I wish I had it more around eight eight
2:53:43
to nine I'm not sure I would do much
2:54:00
I like it off the top of my head I like it 20 to 30. I like it worth I like it being worth 20
2:54:06
to 30 which means I don't love buying it at 17.
2:54:11
I forget the cash flows off the top of my head but it roughly aligns with this chart which is bearish by the way right
2:54:20
there's air cap did I trim this I forget same old story neutral it's kind of
2:54:25
following Airlines flat it's up but it's because it got so low
2:54:30
asps saw this one talk about adding to that one party I'm just following cliff on this
2:54:37
one I'm not gonna lie really I am I like I I don't I forget I
2:54:42
don't think I bought it back in the day but it's that's good enough for me CC starting to pull back that's a
2:54:49
chemical company and look up but still looks good Michael's bullish
2:54:59
that that looks bullish take it it's got a heavy short interest too so I wouldn't be surprised if GameStop kind of follows
2:55:04
that a little bit kind of grouped them together a little bit tgb fall Metals copper
2:55:10
aluminum oh yeah what's this one could trim this one I don't know I don't
2:55:16
love how much the upside is here it's aluminum how much upside you're
2:55:22
gonna get I like it when it's cheap
2:55:30
and Pla I could trim Alcoa I could probably trim alcohol is still
2:55:38
up there I don't even think I've trimmed it yet should have went heavier
2:55:43
GTE oh okay this one I could go heavier than two wow is that 29 cents again
2:55:56
I think I could add to this all their cell knowledge just a percent noise noise noise plus it was June
2:56:05
yeah they went heavy into it oh I could add to this
2:56:12
gotta rebalance the energy exposure I suppose but uh extremely cheap in a pierce price for
2:56:19
bankruptcy Wednesday July 15th yep
2:56:25
gonna say anything I want to say thoughts on GTE I don't know what that means you can
2:56:31
remind me cnx
2:56:37
not the Natural Gas I forgot about cnx as a natural gas but this used to be one of my heavier place
2:56:43
it really fell down I I rebalanced into what I thought were better appear
2:56:51
um rlj this one's holding up okay it seems like a strong balance sheet on this one
2:57:01
Greenbrier I get trim this
2:57:08
this is like a larger Stabler company uh if I needed to be invested I suppose I
2:57:15
could but I I that was one of my
2:57:20
diversification plays I didn't think I was I wasn't super bullish on it per se fet I did I yet oh I did I think I added
2:57:26
like 20 to FDT I think I said that same old play PDS I didn't add to PES yet
2:57:34
mainly because those insiders weren't doing anything damn
2:57:39
I know Bari and all that right
2:57:49
nothing nothing home builder
2:57:56
[Music] um hold it up okay all right this old Valley's pulling back
2:58:03
values just pulled back a couple days I mean energy is leading it to amcx
2:58:12
DXE huh dxc okay did I look this up I forget
2:58:23
no green light sold Glenview I've seen them before that much
2:58:29
Copa Copa Cabana ready we just looked at them Sky West following airlines not
2:58:35
doing much all right we're gonna get through the first hundred positions was it 959 all right
2:58:40
Herman Miller this one looks okay didn't they have a big Buy
2:58:50
yeah they did oh July 7th
2:58:55
not bad solid office supplies all right perion p-e-r-i this one still looks okay
2:59:11
hmm looks good I got in right
2:59:17
right here right as I was breaking out that was like a breakout plan worked out really well
2:59:24
all right oh this one worked out shoot I'm gonna have a yarn to that one
2:59:29
other work this one worked out quick a quick quick double
2:59:35
okay when I think toll was invested in that one too Helix so this is energy pulling back
2:59:41
okay might be offshore offshore
2:59:48
just final energy nothing new getting it what the hell is going are they going bankrupt to what check those real quick
3:00:05
I guess not even talking about it
3:00:21
hey we came across him before Howard Schwartz hey Vince Martin I know him
3:00:30
we didn't get to any of the fundamentals in there but that's okay mg this one always this one kind of looked
3:00:35
interesting too industrial slash energy slashed anyone buy it
3:00:45
Now's the Time to get my attention you know what is it I never understood mistress that's the company they bought
3:00:51
ten thousand ten million shares I don't even know what that means
3:00:57
Slappy day oh I know Lappy days huh
3:01:03
are they legit I know that they're on my phone they're on the funds that I track but I kind of forget off the top of my head how good they are
3:01:11
I don't recognize anything any of these names for better or worse Haynes Brands Huntsman
3:01:17
KRA that's in the portfolio Knowles I've tracked
3:01:23
all right these aren't bad what is this
3:01:32
West Rock I know them I mean it's a small position but
3:01:38
nevertheless just something you know what I mean because I've never I hadn't even heard of this company before a couple months ago
3:01:44
I could add to this when I group it under
3:01:50
I grew up with flr
3:01:56
I guess I don't know keep it going KB Homes home builder tech oh nice
3:02:03
pullback Gap
3:02:08
looks good it's all double that was a solid double easy coppers this could be
3:02:14
a trim remember in my head I didn't think it was that oh there you go the charts
3:02:20
reflect that I remember thinking it's not that undervalued it's already it's more doubled it hasn't tripled
3:02:27
I remember thinking I forget this was a newer company for me
3:02:34
so I mean I'm looking at the chart now I can't say the chart isn't necessarily
3:02:40
I wanted to say 25 to 30 but I'd have to pull up the fundamentals
3:02:51
but I'll pull up the fundamentals before I do that I just unless I can get an A a pretty
3:02:58
confident double or or triple from here
3:03:03
at this point I like although I'm liking keeping a diversified portfolio for the wrong Kitty portfolio right now I am I
3:03:09
don't want to be too heavily focused on what I believe on my top positions because I've done that before it's worked against me and right now I still
3:03:15
think there's quite a bit of uncertainty so I still feel it's not like except for GameStop I and I would I said I was
3:03:21
going to buy more I almost did yesterday and I didn't and then today it popped
3:03:27
um ebix this I think I might have bought on that
3:03:33
day this one I remember that huge pullback I'm like what the hell they had called they had solid cash flow cat
3:03:38
looks okay not ad worthy though because I think so like the chart the charts look okay but I like I kind of know ebix
3:03:45
I don't think it's I don't feel confident that it's worth much more than 40 or 50. it has traded much higher than
3:03:51
that as I recall it was also like the best performer it
3:03:57
was like the best stock for the decade I remember that guy being interviewed and like it was on Yahoo finance
3:04:03
this was back in the day and it was like the best stock for like a 10-year period it went from like 60 cents to whatever
3:04:09
yeah look at the 20 year there you go maybe it was like 2013 or
3:04:14
something 30 cents all adjusted for everything blah blah blah yeah it was like a 10-year then it was a
3:04:22
that would be surprising that that's the best performer but maybe anyway it's traded at 80 bucks before
3:04:29
and I didn't think it was worth 80 but plus the CEO guy in slash founder guy
3:04:34
goes stick I don't care Robin Rayna here you go he goes heavy I
3:04:42
really like that he bought there you go he dropped a million at sub 10. it was sub 10 for one day he was sub 10 for one
3:04:49
day
3:04:57
and he nailed it isn't that sick that's so badass you know your company so well and you know what it's worth and you're
3:05:02
like this is ridiculous boom you see it for like a handful of companies every year this was one of them nailed it I
3:05:09
mean he was buying other times too I don't mean that's his one purchase but IPI just watching from the sidelines I
3:05:16
need to see insiders do something if I come I could trim this I'm done with my icon oh it looks
3:05:23
I mean this is a small position right it could double from here
3:05:29
I see the chart but cash flows cash flow suggested 40 to me I like to remember this because this is a bigger company 40
3:05:36
I could hold it that's that's why I kept some of these it's like it says they're small but it's not number 93 who cares
3:05:42
if I need the cash if I need the cash boom get rid of it iag I added this one
3:05:48
just as a gold position yamana same thing wow yag is a little
3:05:54
bit bigger huh did tracking gold same ednt flat
3:06:00
uh I should look into this one again
3:06:06
that's super difficult to value good luck but there was one time where they earned a ton of art they had a ton of
3:06:11
earnings that a couple of years when they like when they're when they're when
3:06:17
they're earning they're earning I let's I I believe the chart reflects this like there was like I want
3:06:22
to say like seven eight nine dollars in earning something absurd yeah there you go and the chart did it
3:06:28
too like whenever it went I forget but um like legitimate earnings but super
3:06:34
leveraged and tied to the Auto industry um but boy I was I was involved
3:06:42
around this time too when it's done nothing so um I know it's a smaller position now but I was involved before
3:06:47
all this happened and it hasn't really been a big winner um because I was at the time saying the
3:06:53
same thing I'm saying now upside leverage and so forth so just
3:06:59
caveatour so this is that buyer beware cover item tour I think so
3:07:05
um I might have timed it but I even I would have still added around here because
3:07:10
this chart this still looked compelling to me right now I'm like oh maybe it's about to break out and then look at this it was starting to
3:07:16
break out before everything kind of went to anyone do anything with this I could see Adam if someone bought did
3:07:22
anyone buy be a good one come on
3:07:30
nada not a thing damn I need to even told
3:07:37
a little bit and they added a small position it's position number eight you serious
3:07:46
oh oh that's kind of oh so is dxc DXE is a
3:07:53
good one for them too all right tol I looked at Dan I thought it wasn't that
3:07:58
compelling he's good they got oh they got TSC that's right that's right they got Huntsman uh Huntsman didn't look as
3:08:04
cheap to me 80 and T number eight though no and it's not even up that much
3:08:09
it's not even up there if they added that week
3:08:16
if they had a doubt if they had that at the beginning of that week then it's a double but if they added a couple days later which they might have they could
3:08:22
probably have good timing otherwise it's not up that much okay okay but no one's buying isn't this an Irish
3:08:29
company or something no it's based in the US they bought some okay okay
3:08:42
I mean I don't know what my note is here it's kind of like maybe we'll fall follow up on these
3:08:48
later
3:08:53
Signet hasn't really gone up that much I did catch it quite a bit up to that 30. I
3:09:01
think I got lucky on that this and Bed Bath and Beyond I got lucky on all my timing but he I definitely was adding on
3:09:06
down here too and not up that much this is tracking Airlines kind of like
3:09:13
fly and the rest spce kind of speculative I mean really
3:09:19
speculative right oh wow that really blew up and then came back down I have well it's a small position but
3:09:25
that's the thing this is an example of one when I wouldn't I would never buy this one otherwise because I just don't I what the hell do I don't know but
3:09:32
I'm like oh this seems like this could take off I wish I did more of these it turned out to be uh
3:09:37
no it wasn't it wasn't even that big of a winner that's interesting should have bought Tesla you know
3:09:44
hfc all right so refiners kind of so PBF struggling but even Hall hfc struggling
3:09:49
I should have looked that up and what about DK refinish your struggling what are you gonna do no big deal
3:09:58
hfc I consider a higher quality one too so that's okay all right so we got
3:10:03
through we got through uh top 100 let me see if I can remember that okay well I'll make a note
3:10:15
I mean really that for uh for a royal Kitty portfolio 100 chart should
3:10:21
be enough it's crazy that we still have I mean there's 19 to go but really there's only
3:10:27
five to go because all the other ones are nominal in fact I think didn't we check I think I'm down to one
3:10:35
40. 142. I'm down to 142. so there's really
3:10:41
only four pages left it's not worth it today who cares we got some some leads already
3:10:46
but let's try to remember if I can maybe we can pick up where we left off it could be kind of good to um I'm saying
3:10:52
it doesn't matter but like you might find some more compelling opportunities down on those lower
3:10:57
I say you I mean the collective us we might find some more compelling opportunities in those lower Echelon
3:11:03
ones because even though they weren't heavy to begin with maybe they still look relatively more attractive now plus we can look up now with the funds having
3:11:09
filed um if anyone has bought them or anything like that
3:11:15
um so that's why that can be useful even for those smaller positions
3:11:20
I'm just thinking a lot right now is still what we're missing out on um
3:11:25
maybe I should check them out this weekend too impromptu live stream no I'm just kidding do people do that can you just
3:11:32
like spin up and just start live streaming you know what I mean it's probably a thing right oh we should do let me do Cheers Cheers
3:11:39
have a I have a nice have a nice weekend here
3:11:45
um sorry now can I just scroll real quick I just want to see if any name sticks out to me
3:11:52
trox eight-fifths I want to look at the name almost feel like price should be a little bit closer over to oh you see it
3:11:57
is it is on the date although we didn't get to the Daily today that's okay
3:12:03
buckle and GameStop didn't even make the didn't make it above 10 interesting
3:12:12
but I gotta delete this on that that ticker changed
3:12:19
oh really nothing happened today okay so is noise you know what I mean there's like some down in the wrong kid
3:12:25
part of this noise nothing was happening today um okay
3:12:34
nah I don't really see much that's going to be super compelling what did I see BTE we talked about
3:12:42
IO that charts kind of looking ugly energy though no surprise there
3:12:50
uh brfs maybe the Brazilian are they Brazilian like food or something packaged Foods yeah
3:12:57
um cdav that one could be interesting a lot of see a lot of energy plays let's take
3:13:03
the same old flex steel
3:13:09
none of these are going to be super compelling ah the most exciting times are like
3:13:14
March and April every time everything else is like uh we're gonna be straining for doubles and stuff down here
3:13:23
Fable therm Maybe it's around the 30 range
3:13:29
Carpenter I don't even know what that is I added that for um diversification things I'm like oh I
3:13:35
don't know Carpenter that's a steel player I didn't know that conduit nah that's it okay I don't feel
3:13:40
like we're missing out much damn Knack oh that's a cool
3:13:47
those cold ones and you think if natural gas takes off coal is going to take off too even if temporary I don't know
3:13:53
I don't know I'll keep this charts up
3:14:00
Atlas Air yep that was a solid I didn't get it get as much of it as I should but Patrick Industries
3:14:08
fine all right and then the other thing these are all just nominal positions okay cool all right hope you enjoyed
3:14:13
have a nice weekend and um I will see you on Monday all right okay peace out
3:14:20
let's play the uh Kitty video for uh oh the first time tonight all right I need a new um I need a new outro video here
3:14:27
because it's every time I upload I do it on YouTube I upload the live stream it says it's like a copyright notice or
3:14:33
something I paid for the song the song that plays during the outro video but I guess you can still pay for a song and
3:14:38
it can still be a cover issue over it's not being taken down or anything but I'm like I don't want a copyright issue on it so I need to find a new song for this
3:14:44
outro video anyway I'm still rambling here it is 10 15 on Friday all right peace out for real this time
3:14:51
[Music]
