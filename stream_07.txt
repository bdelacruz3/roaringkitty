2:51

and we're off let's do this cheers everybody

2:57

all right let's get right into it i got a little bit of an idea what's going on today but not really so let's just check

3:03

the dashboard first um hope you had a nice weekend by the way i it's um let's see what's going on here

3:11

brazil minus 2.8 so emerging markets what were they doing today oh we'll see on the wrist but that was

3:16

the only thing that was really red all right so not much happening in other words commodities there's always action in commodities silver

3:22

bumping back up there huh just a quick check just hanging bumbling around

3:27

with uh when it goes on when anything you get a big run up at anything like this you expect some volatility of things try to stabilize figure out

3:33

market participants trying to figure out what the hell they're doing do uh they give back the gains keep going up

3:39

um all right so we got copper up there still 290 just as a price point on my head gold's still bumming around say the

3:45

silver palladium up three and a half three point seven percent so kind of like those commodities still looking good

3:50

i think i saw something today that value's been holding up pretty well coming out of the the lows of march it may have even outperformed the s p

3:57

500 that's why it's interesting that people are thinking it's been it's been sucking and i really don't think so but uh anyway commodities tend

4:04

to kind of perform in the same um general form similarly to value so

4:09

anyway keep on seeing commodities popping today and actually we'll see if value did anything today yeah it's kind of like but we'll

4:15

say all right so we oh wheat that's a known wheat and zinc zinc huh so i needed to put in a special

4:20

chart for this you know you can't really get a zinc chart in stock charts but uh look at this boy i

4:26

don't look at oh i don't look at these base these are base metals right uh zinc and um um

4:32

aluminum and there's a lot of them like that down minus four but oh can i have just straight price

4:38

oh i guess price is on the left um it went down to 1840. i don't i don't

4:43

really know the thing price i'm just kind of watching the trend of things how about the longer term trend all right all right it could be a little

4:48

bit of a break out there how far back we got 10 years maybe it's still early just

4:54

i don't know i just never look at zinc you got to pull it up when you see it's up a little bit and then you get aluminum right there what's

4:59

aluminum doing too while we're here oh same same chart kind of forgot that

5:05

look at that oh okay big in 2018 so kind of bouncing a huge jump off the

5:12

lows there huh uh okay okay just curious just curious

5:18

i'm not really gleaning anything from it and then wheat boy i don't think we've looked at wheat yet either right

5:24

that's something to keep an eye on for agricultural related stocks

5:31

i mean the grand scheme of things not much oh this is weekly too but uh a gap

5:38

up though you don't see too many gap ups and wheat i wonder what the news is there in fact if we go to remember this

5:43

let's let's look at adm i wonder if they got some news on wheat i can't think of any other publicly traded companies that there you

5:49

go oh that's august 11th severe weather slams midwest anything else today wheat prices

5:58

i mean how about that let's try this if i go to uh investing.com and i click on wheat it might just care i mean it's usually

6:03

weather related right a drought of some sort will cause this isn't a big jump i'm just saying it's usually weather-related events that

6:09

cause um some of these types of these types of commodities to go all over the place right

6:14

just curious what's it doing oh any new sorry i was coming here for the news any news

6:20

i don't know really there's nothing on here bloomberg

6:30

maybe i should have like a couple of things just to for a quick check on um

6:35

is there a commodity section here let's check maybe maybe i should there we go if i command f

6:43

sorry one more click one more click i promise

6:51

well no news even here gold miners jump all right so oh yeah minor symbol we i guess we'll get to that

6:58

really that's it we command f wheat nothing all right so it's noise but for a gap up there must be something

7:04

i'm just not finding but that's okay i'll come across it i'll come across it randomly later that's cool all right let's keep

7:09

checking um home construction construction still cra

7:14

wow let's let me take a peek at this real quick yeah oh is it breaking i mean it's already at these new all-time high we talk about home builders and home

7:21

construction and it's why cnr is a big position i mean a number in the home builders themselves but i've been trimming out of them because

7:28

i don't know they seem they seem like they're getting close to fair value they could keep on running this is

7:33

i mean they're up three four x a whole bunch of five x on some of them hov was up huge today check this one i

7:39

mean this has been okay this one i mean this is that's sick right i mean

7:45

six is that it's about a six bagger out the lows that was one of the more specular ones but i knew that and uh i looked at retest retest

7:52

retested and seeing technical analysis and but uh 6x i was sick um wasn't my biggest home

7:57

builder i i the bigger positions were some of the safer ones um but this was this was this one

8:04

and a couple of this one says boy this one's the most speculative one huh i almost wish i even put a little bit more in it even though i knew how speculative

8:11

it was because i didn't think it was going to go bankrupt damn okay anyway i see they're crushing it and uh

8:17

but and they can't keep up crushing it so here they are breaking out a little bit of a break out there yeah i don't know still bullish

8:23

what else is there to take from that accepting whole any home related stuff still looking good residential real estate in particular

8:29

shipping that's bullish for the just industrials i mean this isn't an etf or anything it's that company if you recall

8:35

uh myersk myers i don't even know how to pronounce it but uh geez that was up today oh it's

8:41

overbought right now look at this it's overbought on the daily wow

8:47

that's bullish i mean shipping you know like dry bulk

8:52

shipping let me back it out 10 years wow right back up there

9:02

innovation china internet all right some internet stuff oh biotech's been kind of bumbling along there huh yeah not doing

9:09

much kind of just not breaking out like some of those other charts just something to keep my eye on get a couple of biotech stocks in there

9:17

okay um out of curiosity what was value doing today

9:23

momentum was up 1.8 how about russell 2000 oh that'd be over here

9:32

wait where would it be oh right there and a half percent all right so just noise what am i looking for if it lights up

9:37

then i look you know don't what do we need to waste our time for and you know what i just want to check

9:43

just the s p i just wanted to see um remember we're

9:50

like bumping right up against that that limit there what's it doing oh it's flat line it's looking like like like oil there huh just

9:55

i mean i bet a lot of people are just thinking we're at resistance pull back um and we're also not on the overbought

10:01

here boy if you don't if it doesn't make a big leap up here it's a little bit bearish i'll say that a lot of people saying

10:07

that though right and so when a lot of people are saying that but i don't know let's let's see what happens i'd say um traditional thinking

10:14

would suggest uh some sort of pullback here how far i don't know i don't care but uh maybe you trim take off a little

10:20

bit of risk if ideally maybe a couple days ago but i don't really play that game just

10:25

something i keep an eye on just curious and then one thing just tech sorry

10:31

i don't usually do this but we've been doing it the past um couple of streams it's kind of interesting to like lay the

10:36

foundation but before we start looking at other stuff so maybe i'll get more in the habit of doing that just checking in on things when things are going crazy you're

10:42

checking in every day multiple times a day less so but i guess just because there's still a lot of uncertainty right you

10:48

really know no one knows what the hell is going on right now so still i'm still kind of taking the pulse even though it feels like we're getting further and further away from

10:55

craziness nasdaq right there okay i'm just curious

11:01

this this is more like a week a weekly or a bi-weekly type thing you don't need to do it every day that's kind of why i want to just keep

11:07

checking it and getting the habit all right then just the risk column here all right we're at 10 minutes we're doing good we're doing good goldman okay gold miners bounce it back

11:14

oh i did i did pull the trigger on um one of those stocks that we mentioned um i think iag

11:19

i thought i'd add a little bit of glue i didn't touch new gold um because i still want a little bit of a pullback but i just put a just a small

11:25

position ig kind of to get it in the portfolio but um yeah we'll see what happens you see

11:30

and they jumped today right because uh that news was it after hours on friday we talked about that with buffett pulling the

11:35

trigger on barracks a small position and probably wasn't him who directed the trade but uh still nevertheless

11:41

berkshire hathaway invested in gold uh barrick gold i mean so it's going to get the

11:46

it's going to get the headlines and there you go pops right off of it no one's really surprised by that i assume but um but uh

11:54

whatever just watch what's going on right now that's all boy that's kind of a big big candle huh

12:02

whatever keeping an eye on it transocean whatever what's this thing doing is this

12:07

going to go bankrupt this time it don't look that good i don't know don't own it or anything but

12:13

it's like a weight this like risk call right oh i did buy some bait x i know we mentioned that we looked at that

12:18

excuse me just for a little bit but um not a big position but it could build over time but uh did it break a bucket no it's

12:25

already out of buck oh oh it rounds up i only because i don't have any decimal places yeah it's still i bought it based on the

12:32

analysis we did let's let me pull that up what did we say about it on friday

12:39

bte by bte buffett oils oh yeah remember heavy oil i should have i should have kept that up heavy oil wasn't truly

12:44

oil sands because i i dug they didn't present it because so it appeared as though that that so they were grouping

12:50

in is that but bitumen or bitumen i don't even know how to pronounce it bitumen that's more traditional oil sands and they broke

12:56

that out in the annual report i saw that so it looks as though they don't have as much exposure to oil sands but still

13:02

heavy oil it's in the same it's in the same ballpark so if heavy oil of oil sands stocks are

13:08

getting priced up so will stocks exposed to heavy oil whatever the exact definition is it doesn't matter

13:13

too much but um so so i bought some i thought all right let's let's start going based on that research i had seen enough

13:18

i'm not totally convinced minimal insider buying and that fund that had taken a position uh i don't know like greater than five

13:26

percent position i don't know how how reliable that's going to be so not super bullish but definitely one to keep an eye and even

13:32

for for berkshire it was a small position just something like i some people were kind of writing off oil sands and like i said even

13:38

myself myself with the oilsands and the offshore drillers i didn't really see a need to to go into

13:44

those too heavy because there was all these other opportunities in uh what i would consider less speculative oil

13:49

in gas companies so um but the fact that berkshire was willing to add and they're they're

13:55

long-term thinkers right so if even if they're not yet thrown in the tunnel i'm not going to throw in the towel either see how simple that analysis is i'm not

14:01

i'm i concede i'm not an expert on oil sands or where energy prices are going or any of that stuff but uh

14:07

it can be as simple as that and it's in the context of a full portfolio you know what i mean okay um all right so this wrist

14:15

things are lighting up today lighting up green huh that's the first thing i just checked like green it's green today right and um really this should be a weekly

14:22

thing too who cares on the day-to-day because these things are naturally inherently going to be volatile that's that's their nature

14:28

um but um but still all right bay texas up five percent tech

14:33

was up twelve four percent nice savannah we saw palladium and uh platinum were up in the commodity

14:39

sphere over here oh i didn't scroll down we would have seen the miners up today should have done that um what was

14:46

palladium up three point seven percent so i wanted to add remember we talked about this i wanted to add to sbsw

14:53

sabanya damn i was wait i wanted to uh oh this was friday yeah there you go

14:59

that's i mean this could be bullish this could keep on running i would have preferred under 10 i felt like i kind of missed it there but um

15:06

if this trend holds up this thing could i could envision this dublin

15:12

how high did it get it only got there but i think it actually could go quite a bit higher this was base this was before

15:18

this was before when was that still water merger i think it was in 2016.

15:28

um anyway so anyway now with palladium getting bit up and is more interested in it i feel like this could go

15:34

significantly higher much higher take out the previous highs it's real tough to value though so but if it's trendy if you got gold you

15:40

got palladium sometimes the market doesn't give a about what those free cash flows are it's just they want that asset on their

15:46

books you know what i mean i see it over and over again and that's what often what i'll try to do is forecast what's going to be

15:52

heavily in favor looking out 12 months what has the characteristics that could kind of be sexy in the future and something like

15:59

this has uh i feel like it has those characteristics and um i mean that's why it's up five it's

16:05

already up 5x from those 2018 lows but a lot of stuff was but even from here i feel like i could keep running but it's trendy it's

16:10

you got to keep your eye on the trend that's the thing uh but if commodities keep them yeah

16:16

maybe maybe i should add i keep on i'll add on pull back did i already say that is sbsw in the uh i get some things

16:23

broken today it looks like oh it's not in my um it's not on the buy list all right i think i'll add it

16:32

did i remove it just something to keep an eye on that's all

16:39

all right let's get back let's let's finish this wrist column let's go let's go let's go toll brothers yep these are the

16:44

home builders crushing it like these are some are what i would consider they're not they're relatively safe

16:50

compared to hov hov should be in this list actually no well maybe it should be

16:57

actually i think it should be in this list i consider it the most one of the most speculative of the home builders so where i have home builders in here not

17:04

so much i mean it's the risk the risk column i have home builders in here more as a keeping a finger on the pulse of

17:09

residential real estate because as i was saying last time it's a big part of the us economy and if those are those are crushing it that bodes well um

17:17

but for a wrist column seems like hov should be in there too huh

17:30

wrist section i don't even know what the hell i call it anyway okay so we know all those in fact oh just let me just let me just

17:35

check the uh charts on some of these you know what i mean so are we going to see a lot of the same viz lennar

17:41

toll yeah they're all broke look at that there they go there they go it's only one day it's

17:46

only one damn what's what is it kbh all right and then tesla oh my tesla

17:54

telling you what we i think i said this in the stream i it seems like oh everything was up there oh bit is bitcoin up too bitcoin there

18:00

you go so i'm not yeah i have no idea about these short-term moves i'm just saying what i

18:06

think other people are seeing and those things look bullish on tesla i think i i i in my head that

18:12

big round number of 2 000 how is it not coming for 2 000 you know what i mean

18:17

this is this is i'm speculating here this isn't like value investing but i'm like this is more market

18:23

behavior type stuff that this is undeniably bullish what's the market cap what the hell

18:32

what the hell it's so 250 300 340 350.

18:42

cheers cheers tesla and musk wow 340 million oh

18:49

i don't know how many shares i was thinking what i wonder what um what uh how do we get to one one

18:55

trillion dollar market cap uh oh i guess just three times that roughly right okay

19:00

wow i mean valuation wise i don't know i i doubt it but chart wise and in

19:07

psychology wise and mark his sentiment it's screaming bullish i don't know i know some value investors

19:13

are shorting and i think i feel like i've said this before because i believe it's strongly what the hell i don't know how you could

19:18

touch this with a ten-foot pole and if you are going to touch it how are you not bullish i i'm

19:24

you know what i mean i don't own it don't know position no position maybe i

19:29

should have bought it but even i can't i can't i can't justify that it's what if i i'll say this looks bullish right

19:35

but i'm not i'm still a valiant investor at heart right so it's tough for me when i see 340 billion i can't

19:40

i just watch as a spectator maybe you do like for the story or something but i'll do the but there's a lot of stuff that looks

19:47

like this like you do bitcoin too and bitcoin seems like it maybe has more it's it's like infinitely tougher to

19:53

value so i feel like there's probably more upside because of that maybe i'm wrong but uh what was this is this was it why

19:59

was it up so much by the way tesla shares rally for no reason yes

20:05

that's sick that ticket was as soon as i was asking why was it up huh oh who wrote that tech crunch is that yahoo

20:10

finance oh that's that is funny for no reason oh that's awesome

20:20

and hilarious right i mean how do you not laugh at that i don't even know what to say actually

20:26

just just watch in amazement um and what was bitcoin doing i mean

20:32

bitcoin looks bitcoin let's bullish i it broke above 12 aren't we waiting for it to break a bitcoin trust look at that

20:38

we added that to the roaring kitty portfolio just in time

20:46

i think i added it right here it's uh i added in the uh this was friday thursday i definitely

20:53

added it in the i didn't get i think i added in the 13th i mean just in time right who cares this is noise

20:58

it'll come back tomorrow but i just mean you gotta laugh at that right let's see what it does this looks

21:04

bullish i don't know oh what a fun day our value investors

21:09

flipping their today and then blockchain this one looks up that group this this one's a ridiculous

21:16

um i had bought this back in june for similar reasons you know what i

21:23

mean um i don't i don't think i still own it though i think i traded it out of something else but same thing these are all it's

21:29

all this is all in the same in my head this is how i'm functioning wow big day for the for some

21:35

some of the more speculative things all right let's keep going 720 that's not bad we got through the dashboard 720 kind of got a feel for stuff do i feel

21:42

like checking on anything i should institute like a weekly go through like emerge like i don't have a

21:47

what's emerging markets doing today you know what i mean currencies uh that's that might be a monthly thing uh where's

21:53

this is region all world xus i bet it looks like remember those european india yeah yeah yeah okay oh this looks a little

21:59

even better oh i gotta turn this off too

22:07

emerging markets one that says eeo yep oh looks good uh values in play

22:13

value commodities emerging markets it's in play good that's good news for me roaring

22:20

kitty all right let's close out of some of this stuff keep it moving let's just check roaring kitty portfolio i don't

22:25

even know where i'm where i'm going today we're just we're just winging it today we're going damn this sucks that this is kind of broken that's okay i i haven't been

22:32

i do heavily rely on these these three columns right here um during crunch time i have we haven't

22:37

been checking up on that too much it's always annoying when something's not working you know uh all right so uh

22:43

oh you see gamestop look at this it's um it's a huge chunk of the portfolio now

22:48

oh over ten percent i uh i don't know oh uh um that video is

22:55

close the game stuff video is close it's taking me it's taking me a while it it should be out this week i

23:00

um i try to boil everything down to just a couple of minutes trying to hone my um video editing skills a bit and

23:08

i hope you like it there's not much new it hasn't been much new to a report except um some of the sony and nintendo numbers

23:14

are out on percentage of like physical versus digital and stuff so i was able to touch on that and then what

23:19

else um oh the the fun the fun holdings were out so we got some updated numbers on

23:25

that front i mean not much change that was pretty much the same so there's not much new it's more just like testing out a

23:30

different way of presenting some of the information and so anyway it should be out this week

23:35

um and then wow so yeah that's i just updated this 11 huh

23:43

let's check this consumer discretionary is it 28 now specialty retail 16

23:51

all right and i have some exposure outside of the roaring kitty portfolio

23:57

right um do i own enough

24:03

i don't know uh okay cnr all right this that's been up but we've been watching this one oh you know what i should do oh

24:09

we didn't get through the charts last time okay let me just let's just see what move real quick rfp was up time

24:16

today huh yeah look at that i didn't get to add in time

24:22

look at this i mean it's a fourth it's the fourth position the portfolio but i've been wanting to add to these bigger

24:27

these bigger stocks and to do that i got to trim out of the smaller position so i did that a little bit past couple days um

24:35

was it on any news oh what's this 10th no that's no news

24:44

anything on seeking alpha is it just it's probably just up on um

24:50

residential real estate and lumber prices and stuff what's lumber do

24:57

[Music] um

25:06

wow i mean how high can that go though huh whoa that's super bullish

25:14

so rfps at least partially right on that train damn hope i didn't miss out on that this could be uh i'm pretty bullish on

25:21

um rfp i missed it i saw it this day i didn't i

25:26

didn't i didn't get to it in time i wanted to get below three would have been nice i'm not a huge ad but

25:31

it's okay keep moving new gold eight percent of course camping world camper world

25:37

bouncing back this is go you know i didn't i um in the roaring kitty portfolio i didn't

25:43

trim anything following that huge sell-off remember we said let's let's just see what happens let's see what happens this is a super bullish trend right here

25:49

plus the fundamentals still look compelling i don't know it's not i don't envision it being a five beggar from here but i still thought

25:55

oh we could get another double out of this um so i wanted to just wait and see and here you go it's coming back and i saw the uh

26:01

um the ceo there was buying more not too much for him 100k a couple hundred k

26:06

see this he's been doing it um oh he's been doing it every day 10 11 12 13 14. you know i like to see that

26:12

if you've seen my other videos you know i like insider mine he's kind of making a point look at that 100k 100k 100k

26:18

sick boy that's half a mil but you know what i mean he's not afraid he did half a mil in june he's not messing around

26:27

what's it is it did abrams take any more no they didn't they only trimmed they're trimming

26:35

they sold a million of their six million so what's that about about 15 25 in

26:41

between there i don't know yeah i kind of like it i mean i've been

26:46

tr excuse me i've been trimming it up till earnings i didn't trim it following to sell off the uh what was it of 10 15 sell off but i've

26:53

been trimming all the way because it's been such a huge winner you know what i mean it was taking over the portfolio and i didn't know i thought

26:58

i didn't know it was going to be as bullish as it was gonna be i wish i held more but um so now i'm just keeping an eye on it right now but you know what i mean it

27:04

would have been by far the biggest position in the portfolio where is it it's 15 because yeah but

27:10

still uh okay boy this is a bullish day huh cvgi that's not going to pull back you

27:15

know i've been wow damn i remember i was saying i didn't think that i wasn't sure that that

27:21

pullback would hold this is bullish you know this is i mean this is um like a i think we did i think we did a fair value

27:27

estimate here i think i said 8 to 12 or something like that which aligned with the chart i remember that and uh boy it's taking off huh

27:35

never pulled back cool oh 11 today any news on that

27:43

it's a bummer it was so volatile before i mean that's not always an indication as to what the hell it's going to do we

27:48

all know that all right no news i think is it which kind of feels like

27:53

value is kind of i mean look at all these no 5 10 moves on some of these you know uh

27:59

i would have thought value was up to more today you know where is that

28:05

just getting real lucky i get value s p 500 value is down well they're all down today is this up to date s p value

28:12

but russell was all up huh how about some of the uh

28:21

mutual funds ah it doesn't matter who cares who cares let's keep going let's keep going 727 can we at least get through these

28:26

moves i mean what am i going to do check all these movers i don't know look at that we already checked that bitcoin truck good timing

28:32

huh look at that sick let's see if it keeps running that's all that matters um revolve yeah i kind of missed the

28:39

boat on that anything that um

28:45

oh well then keeps going down whoa let's see that's that don't look that great

28:51

that don't look that great i think i like it though

28:56

i that one let's add this to the buy list i mean i need to dig in deeper

29:01

all right let's let's check it out oh you know what i where'd it go it's down today everything

29:07

else is up that sticks out when everything's down and something's up or everything's up and something's down it kind of sticks out to me

29:12

i feel like did we did we look at this i forget um spr oh i trimmed i trimmed a whole bunch

29:18

of the airlines for no real reason um it wasn't a huge position on the portfolio but

29:25

we talked about the other day and i'm like what there's no need to have um significant exports i still have spr

29:30

that's a way to play it but um yeah i don't know i have not particularly bullish or super

29:36

bearish i just don't know and there's all these other positions that i would consider myself more bullish on

29:44

spr down wow gi down okay that's i think we wanted around 10 right yeah maybe we'll come back so i'm

29:50

starting to remember this is good i'm starting to remember what i'm looking for what i'm waiting on flr

29:56

i should just be going through the charts right now you know what i mean i don't want to waste too much time just open up so what i mean like this is kind of slow open up the chart go down open

30:02

up the chart go down what the hell fly twi sixteen percent uh group though

30:08

okay so cvgi twi crushing it was they did they have news today that i would wanna read

30:16

wow okay

30:24

nothing nothing okay whatever that's what i mean

30:31

when you don't see any news like this and a whole bunch of the names it's kind of like what's coming in favor here um some people trying to get exposure to

30:37

small cap value the operations be damn it's like i mean sometimes it could be that suddenly

30:42

everyone just became aware of these stocks but that's unlikely it's more just positioning i think in the sector and

30:48

well prty didn't came down wow okay that's okay it's i feel like that guy

30:54

knows what he's doing uh it's just a play based on uh what i've seen work in the past we'll see what happens it was up so much wasn't

31:00

like 20 or something on friday what see what i mean no big deal um hiking total minus six all right just

31:08

uh all right we kind of get the gist of it damn michaels is going to take off did i think i already listed that as a missed opportunity whatever okay

31:14

okay so the only oh ipi did that are they down today they did that reverse split i would they did do a

31:19

reverse split i um but unless they're bi and i got nothing to look at there

31:26

yamana in the portfolio oh yeah oh i ag oh i i put more and i ig's a bigger

31:32

position than yamana damn

31:38

probably should have bought more yamana i think i like it a bit more don't ask me why i don't even know

31:45

okay so some things are down today these are all small positions right point three point three cyh oh what's

31:52

cyh is doing kind of bouncing around i could see this

31:57

i could see this this is one so i can see this being a big winner also this chart looks this char looks freaking interesting um

32:03

this is like a hospital owner or a hospital i think they own they own the hospitals

32:09

but look at this chart like it's super leveraged too this is one of those ones that could run so i've been kind of keeping my eye on it ever since

32:16

um since this turnaround oh no oh you know what i was early i was

32:22

i was watching around here and then it just so happened the trend broke down again oh okay and then i was now i'm just

32:28

watching i mean look at this and like they're taking actions to deleverage i should probably read up on the story

32:34

hard to value though ton of revenues let me pull it up

32:41

i trimmed some of those shippers shippers were one of those that just asset plays would have worked out well for a while and now they're um

32:48

are tankers excuse me tankers um still get some exposure but and

32:53

they're it's actually the charts look good as in like they're kind of basing a little bit it's probably just to hold i just don't have i don't have super high conviction in

32:59

those types of plays

33:07

anything else cyh plt all right not much else kind of quiet cci now we're down into the i just own

33:13

like five shares of these just something or i don't even know something small okay oh i'm getting down on the number

33:18

of positions so uh where does it get to so i'm down to 145 positions all right

33:25

all right i still think i want to trim just a little bit more um cndt that's what we bought because of carl

33:31

it's down like 10 15 pretty quick but it's also the smallest position in the portfolio right for good reason right we're just trying to get it in the

33:36

portfolio keep an eye on it okay one thing i did do today before we keep moving whatever we're going to do

33:42

next is i bought sand ridge so you may have seen this no i added i took a peek at it on

33:47

i guess i don't remember saturday but i had added it to the portfolio

33:54

i forget when but i i was adding maybe it was to july i can't remember but and i got some exposure outside of it

34:00

and i may have mentioned the stream i honestly don't remember but uh the chart was looking good and it's a way to play

34:05

um energy and a little bit natural gas but carl icahn was involved

34:10

and um i hadn't fully read up on the story like i did a little bit of a deeper dive because something caught my attention in fact you know what i did it

34:16

friday night after the stream i forget if we look did we look at something did it come up

34:23

i remember looking at bte i don't remember looking at oh you know what you know why because i um because i

34:31

i pulled up that we were going through the funds we looked at barry's and berkshire maybe we pulled up carl icahn's

34:36

but um that got my attention friday night i'm

34:41

like it was an unchanged position like i kind of just forgot about it some things when they're smaller positions that's i don't retain

34:47

everything so it's the smallest excuse me it was the smallest position of the portfolio but no change right

34:53

this is a 60 million dollar market cap company which is a little bit unusual for someone like carl to have that position right

34:59

and to be honest i didn't have the full story it was just a a way to to get exposure to the industry and stuff

35:04

then i saw this no change and he still kept it in the portfolio and it's such a small company in tentacle tentacles in the wrong kitty

35:10

portfolio too right and he added but i'm like wait a second let me just dig a little bit deeper into the center so then i started reading the

35:16

whole story and uh i'm embarrassed i didn't know it in greater detail but carl's been

35:22

involved since 2018 and they were getting uh he was trying to shake things up he was buying in like between like fit around the 15

35:28

range up to dollars per share and um

35:33

but this is the thing i like i think we did this on friday i don't always go full in on research i can't do full research i can't track so many companies

35:39

go heavy on the research right off the bat that's not how i function i i need to do things incrementally that's just how it works

35:44

unless i see something super compelling like super crazy insider buying or a huge sell-off or whatever like that the market's cratering

35:49

then i'll dig in deep super quick but for something like this sometimes i'll just get the position of the portfolio and then as things unfold is that as a

35:55

big update as an insider takes a position as a value investor starts talking about it's in their portfolio blah blah blah and then

36:01

i need something to to to kind of like poke me like hey go ahead go look at this and that's what i'm with sandra so then i

36:07

started like you just do a google search of the name sandridge and carl icahn and he was getting involved

36:14

right around um 28 like late 2018 like after this so they had one they had filed for bankruptcy we came

36:19

back uh uh ipod again um he was getting involved right around here this uh oh was it that late

36:28

july was he this early oh that's not as high as i thought it was they didn't pay any dividends did they

36:35

okay so i don't know when he got involved it doesn't matter he was getting involved in this area um i could have sworn it was even higher

36:42

than this maybe he got no it may have been late 2017. i think it might have been late 2017. yeah i think it was doesn't matter he

36:48

was getting involved much higher but it does doesn't matter a little bit do a google search pretty sure it was in the 17s and so he's been involved all this time

36:55

and then he had to get control of the board he thought they were doing a job they almost did a ridiculous merger with i think bonanza creek or whatever that company i used to watch

37:01

that company was clearly going bankrupt i wasn't following the story at the time but merging with that i can tell you it

37:06

would have been stupid just based on what i was seeing i'm no expert so and then he stopped the merger got the other investors on board you can see

37:12

his letters and stuff i always like to read the letters anyway you kind of follow the story there's a story being told not just in

37:18

the chart but fundamentally and you see carl uh he does the votes he

37:23

gets control of the board he oust the ceo late last year this is november december that's not i mean

37:28

we're talking eight months ago right before all this crash like he's like still having involved and then this happens right not just covid but what's going on in the

37:34

oil and gas industry and then of course it justifiably just collapses well justifiably i mean it deserves to

37:40

sell off with everything else but it appears as though it was overdone and i'm not one to say carl's going to screw this up you know what i mean like

37:46

he's in this i um it could be that because this is such a big shift industry-wide that um that

37:54

maybe the games change and maybe he uh he bit off more than he could chew just because this would have been

37:59

difficult to foresee but i doubt it um so i mean i concede that point if that's what that's what happens but i

38:05

doubt it and this is uh i think that it will bounce back i think the energy

38:10

industry even if it doesn't hit historic highs that uh a company like sandridge will bounce back if you

38:15

watch what they've been doing too they've been drastically cutting costs and they're selling their headquarters right now they just announced it in their latest press release they're going

38:21

to net like 35 million or something and i think that's going to more than cover debt they could have no doubt in the balance sheet so that's the real

38:27

that's the big that's the thing that stuck out to me if um can i pull that up

38:33

um pull up right to the 10 to the 10. so this was this is from a

38:38

couple weeks ago but that's what got my so i knew i i knew the chart and um and i knew carl

38:44

or i'm being reminded of carl and then i see the story playing out but then let me check this balance sheet because when it comes to like these super

38:49

speculative industry not super volatile industries cyclical industries and stuff like you can't you just can't have a ton of debt

38:55

if you do it's fine but like it'd have to be a small position so then i pull up the balance sheet then i'm like whoa wait a

39:00

second here uh they had 13 million in cash assets held for sale 35 million which i think it's already closed i think they got the

39:06

35 million this is important because game stops doing something similar well they're doing a sale lease back on some of their headquarters and

39:13

distribution facilities or warehouses or whatever the hell it is and i don't know how much they're going to get it could be 50 million i'm

39:18

guessing like 50 60 million but couldn't it could be 100 but i doubt it i lean more to i try to go on the conservative

39:23

side but 50 million for a company like gamestop that could go a long way they got a hundred in authorization too anyway my point just being selling

39:29

assets can be a really intelligent thing to do

39:34

for companies whose backs are get up against the wall i don't think game stops up against the wall but i do think sandridge is a little bit

39:41

and so this 35 so you got 13 million in cash just as a quick there's additional things to consider but just quickly look at the balancing judith 13 million cash

39:47

35 assets held for sale which i think has already closed so there you got almost 50 million in cash uh a ton in uh approved reserves

39:53

and stuff like that right for just table the reserve for just a moment assume it's just for sake of discussion

39:59

i got almost 50 million in cash and then current maturities of long-term debt 59 million

40:05

and that's it that's it that's it this is all you this is this

40:10

is what you this sell-off is for what uh the the the questionable value of the assets right

40:16

and uh in some cases with companies like this too are they are they lower quality reserves that they have like it would

40:22

cost more to get the oil and natural gas out of the ground because that's something that needs to be priced in you deserve to sell off

40:27

because it's just more costly to run your operations you need more capital and so forth blah blah blah but like

40:33

this type of a sell-off if you say if you say here you go here's the chart oh yeah this this company's super

40:38

leveraged it if i mean everything was everything had an ugly chart in march that's not totally fair but i would just assume that they're

40:45

screwed i uh it just looks like and then when i open this up i'm like what the hell

40:50

50 million you're almost going to fully cover your long-term debt not that they should paid off i'm not saying anything

40:55

like that but that is not that much leverage at all it's manageable just um a priori you know what i mean

41:01

even without digging through the balance sheet i just kind of in my experience that's

41:07

a terrific position to be in for such a speculative company that seems to be trading well below what fair value probably is

41:15

at the very least based on what carl icahn saw i don't know what he saw exactly but read his letters and stuff i read through those um you know a lot

41:22

of stocks just have a story that many people aren't dialed into some people are i don't really i don't get it but the

41:27

story that i'm seeing made me super bullish on sandwich friday night and saturday and that's why on

41:33

saturday i'm like what the hell buy i mean it was in the portfolio already but i'm like buy sandwich

41:38

so that's what i did today hold on just i forget what it is off the top of my head it look right out of the bat so it's

41:44

already 1.2 percent of the position of the portfolio and i get some exposure outside of the royalty portfolio too but like i'm like i've seen enough i've seen

41:50

enough for this to be um a good chunk of the portfolio um and i may even add more i

41:56

the problem is it was up like 20 on friday and so that but i mean that got my attention well excuse

42:01

me i mean i my first i think i was buying like a dollar 30 or something in july which turned out to be a really timely

42:07

purchase and then but now i'm realizing and now it's like a dollar eighty but right but it's not a big deal because it could be

42:12

a it could be a five bigger hell it could even be a ten bag you know what i mean so it's annoying it's a little bit

42:18

frustrating but it shouldn't stop you from pulling just pull the trigger out of the bat and then if i want to build it even more maybe then i'm like all right should i

42:24

wait should i wait for a pullback not that i have any idea what the hell it's gonna do in the short term but um so what else is i just gonna see

42:31

so and then you have all the reserve i mean just there's a question of the actual value

42:37

of the stuff do i have two things i just want to check real quick the first is bonds i did look at the bonds and they were still

42:44

um actually do i have it right no i guess i don't have it there

42:52

they were still how come some of those same some of them didn't that's weird huh oh let me just do this

42:57

what i'm pretty sure uh did i not

43:02

no it didn't no of course what am i doing right we just know that there it's such a small dollar amount that they're probably not even publicly traded they

43:08

may even be privately held i'm not exactly sure it doesn't matter who cares it's there's or it doesn't matter that much

43:14

but i did want to see the fundamentals i think i pulled them up right

43:19

did i pull them off yes i did number

43:24

four what do we got oh so here we go so

43:32

so um when it when i when it came back public again coming out of bankruptcy right had 24

43:37

dollars in book value per share as you hear me say often i mean oil and

43:42

gas book value who knows right i've been as many value investors have we've been um

43:48

we've been um double crossed by book value many times and but now you get experience with it but especially in the past couple years

43:54

right it's how it works but it's fine and you we see this in some of the natural gas players too it's not that big a deal because

44:00

as long as it's time you're buying way below what that tangible book value is then that's good you know what i mean

44:06

that's all i'm saying and so it was 24 bucks back in the day and now it starts at two dollars so it's

44:12

was that 112th 112th of what book value was right there so we remember what the environment was

44:17

where oil was trading and stuff and things are structurally different right it's not the same environment i get that but that's not the point the point is these simple rules of thumb

44:24

can work over time so anyway so that was the first thing that caught my attention and then obviously they had huge write downs right twenty dollars

44:31

twenty dollars per share almost twenty dollars per share i'm looking right here right there 18.41 uh for our earnings

44:37

per share and then book value right now it's four dollars and 88 cents almost five dollars and we're still we're still this is as of june 30th you

44:44

like to think that they wrote it down accordingly and that's a fair assessment of what reserves are worth today giving everything that's

44:50

happened but it's still messy but i don't care i see two dollars per share i see five dollar book there you go another green flag right

44:56

um and then you look at the net common overhang like well it does say it's levered but at least from a book to that common

45:03

overhang perspective it's not that levered um positive operating cash flow two dollars per share over the past

45:09

12 months in operating cash flow um negative simple free cash flow right and look at the huge revenue decline

45:15

right major revenue decline uh but it may partly be because um there's many reasons for this revenue

45:21

client you're going to see this across the energy industry it's no big deal really it's no big deal for a company in

45:26

the energy industry these days it's it comes with the territory

45:31

but also just the sheer size of revenues i kind of like this kind of a size company which brings the question he got even at

45:36

um even if it were was that five times bigger it was still a small company for carl to get involved

45:42

in isn't it i can't say for sure i don't i thought he usually get on larger companies um

45:47

but uh what else did anything else catch my attention like that was it it's really the balance sheet once i see

45:53

i get excited when i see the balance sheet and i think the balance sheet doesn't look like i see there's a lot of the top

45:58

positions in the roaring kitty portfolio are because of that and that's when you see i'll pull the trigger quick and i'll build a quick

46:04

heavy position because i feel as though downside is relatively limited you know what i mean just look at all that's happened and then the

46:10

upside it's like i don't even take spend that much time piecing together the upside i just like if i were to make it like the video

46:16

i'm making for a game stop right now if i were to make it for sandwich i could i could cover everything in 60 seconds i think i really think i could and you

46:22

might say well that's not comprehensive thorough fundamental analysis and maybe you're right i'm just telling you in my experience it has worked

46:28

historically and we'll let's see what happens with sandridge i um i don't have any short-term predictions but if i'm

46:33

looking out a year two years three years something like this has the characteristics of like a

46:40

five-bagger type even from here and it still hasn't even really participated it's barely a double off

46:45

the low some of these other energy companies look at ovv i mean that was a big winner for for me

46:51

and uh that's up look at this you know what i mean like and maybe if there's some there's a good reason for this you know what i mean obvi has

46:57

higher quality assets blah blah blah that's not the point i'm just saying just sign up that much off the lows that's all that's all i'm saying that's

47:02

all i'm saying don't hold it against me um but uh was there anything else i just wanted to

47:08

show quickly um was there was there an article there's probably lots there maybe did i check out the articles

47:14

i forget oh no certainly did was there something oh maybe do we pull it up together yeah it's all this guy i've seen his research

47:21

before but it's not it's not my style of research so there wasn't much here

47:28

yeah i don't know maybe i'm wrong i don't know if you have any if if if i'm crazy for i don't know i don't

47:34

think i'll create the balance sheet would i you talk about i talk about confidence scores in some of my videos and i try to

47:40

apply confidence scores to some of my positions and stuff like that but i've learned that the balance sheet strength is a big part of my

47:46

uh is my of my confidence and my willingness to go heavy enough positions and stuff for the most part like something like c

47:52

and r it's actually not that strong of a balance sheet which makes it a weird thing although it's it's been it's been good to the

47:57

portfolio because i did a good job everything down but i was buying in at before too but anyway but in their case they don't have um the

48:04

long-term maturities on the debt and they don't have um um restrictive covenants or anything like that because the firm's

48:10

it's a long story but generally and same thing for new gold i mean not every position right like new gold is a speculative goal i have my reasoning

48:16

right but many of these they have on they're on the stronger side of balance sheet relative to other players in the industry perhaps

48:22

um anyway i i might add more to standards now i'm kind of just watching and it was kind of up today and uh

48:28

i got some exposure out of the wrong kitty portfolio as well but uh yeah anyway i thought that was kind of exciting because we looked at

48:34

that and um and uh it's not often that that happens because i'm tracking so many but every once in a while something come up and

48:39

i'm like how the hell how the hell did i not know about this story how did i miss it over the years that's gonna happen when you're tracking

48:45

so many and then it's kind of fun be like oh this it this has this this has that this

48:50

has this um because it's not as common these days all right so that's that that's the sandwich

48:55

that's the sandwich story let's see what happens i don't i don't really have much else there's not much more to show on it it's

49:02

not so much a numbers game with the exception of what book value was and is

49:07

um and that it's generating operating cash flow and isn't necessarily super leveraged you know what i mean like that's the thing you see positive

49:13

operating cash flow for some of these companies i mean not not free cash all right but still there's it matters operating cash

49:18

flow but um like if it were to be diluted or anything like that this i don't know it

49:24

has a lot of stuff that i like to see is there any other buying beside that

49:31

march oh no no nothing right nothing there oh that's the thing too so when somebody i have a theory maybe

49:37

maybe it's common sense or maybe it's i don't like when some of these larger hedge funds or more prominent

49:43

investors get involved with the company especially if they haven't controlling staking like that everything everyone else backs off they're like all right

49:48

that's that's carl's company um and or the funds that are of size can't even

49:54

take a position because it's so small you know what i mean 60 million market cap who what can you even do what can you do with that it's for people

49:59

like me uh who who might be able to catch that i think let's see how it plays out but even with some of the larger firms like

50:05

um um tsc like i'm i was surprised like not that many people were buying into tsc

50:11

but that's because there's a there's a fund in there that owns over 20 of the company now uh was it mm and mm and mng investment management um

50:20

but uh yeah i don't know just sit there oh total bought more oh i forgot they own it good just a

50:25

small amount more and 10 increase but um yeah anyway i and so i'm not the insider buying i mean

50:31

carl has replaced all the damn insider so that's why like carl's taking steps i wasn't gonna pull it off i don't know i say this about the gamestop management

50:37

team are they gonna pull off i don't know i'm just saying that uh everyone else is betting that it's not possible for it to

50:43

to turn around it's like that's ridiculous what do you mean it's not possible to you can't even apply like a 20

50:48

probability that something can happen like come on that's um that's basic statistics come on and

50:53

so the same same thing with sandridge here's like if you see that carl's actually taking the steps and he's they're cutting costs they've

50:59

like cleared they cleaned house they cleaned the board i mean this is something again i'm making a lot of comparisons to gamestop

51:04

here because i'm seeing a lot of things fundamentally unfold that are taking a long time for stuff to get person i feel like those types of

51:10

events just take a while to get priced in and also um like who's going to be who would

51:16

be buying sandridge right now who's out there to buy that stuff it's not like it's got it's not big enough for huge funds to get involved or

51:21

institutions and etfs and stuff and and everyone's just tired of energy companies and stuff so

51:27

i don't know let's see what happens um but that was a big jump up and i took

51:33

i made some other what time we got 50. all right we're doing good we're doing good did i make i made some other like um

51:38

yeah i talked about this like i should have something i made a note of that did i make a note of that

51:47

i should have something so that when i i don't know is it easy to do i can do it i definitely can do this um

51:53

add feature and spreadsheet to see position changes it's going to

51:59

take me a little bit of time though to do that but what i do is i it's so annoying everything i try to see these

52:05

spreadsheets i try to have everything automated but i can't i can't automate the damn positions in the portfolio to get them into the

52:10

spreadsheets i i literally manually download a spreadsheet and paste them in but what i can do is when i paste the

52:15

data i can paste it to a different area and then it can calculate the difference in sharing to share a number of shares and stuff

52:21

and i can have it output i'm thinking i'm i'm thinking right now i can have it output to a new spreadsheet that that's

52:27

the difference between the two and then it presents it and says here were the changes to the portfolio that's definitely doable um

52:32

even with this stupid manual effort it's just going to take me a little time i can't do it right now i get to finish that damn game stop video it's

52:38

taken me a while to to learn the final cut and pick up these damn plugins and stuff but once i get

52:44

once i get some time i'll add something like that to it but in the meantime it's just whatever i can remember um

52:50

to see position changes and just let me just check our analysis that we did bed bath and beyond hp pds oh i didn't

52:56

buy pds but um because we didn't see much we looked into it i didn't i want some insider buying or something it's just another

53:02

energy player at this time keep buying gold ideally buy more at 1800 perhaps by one percent more income

53:07

prices okay so i didn't look at this but that was why i added like iag i know it's not one percent but i'm like all right let's just get i just i felt

53:13

like i needed a little bit more right now um consider iag yep because of the buffett bomb everyone was saying

53:20

that though there's nothing unique there right i bought bte i mentioned that oh i didn't look into the share

53:25

instruments uh you know what i mean i'll look into that stuff remind me remind me to look at that cherish since you remember the huge jump in the share

53:31

count for some reason but remember they refinanced straight before in january that was sick uh trimbiex bxe was up today or was that

53:37

briefly and add to cvj on the pullback and of course of course it's up it was up to 11 it's it they the market

53:44

read my notes they read my notes and they said nah nah let's bounce it ain't anything get an ad more to the

53:50

royal kitty portfolio this time look into mac um maybe we'll do that i don't feel like doing that today add to dbi

53:56

again what did it do oh because uh barry he's stealing my

54:03

picks bar are you stealing my picks we're on to you we're on to you you're not fooling anybody he's probably

54:09

watching the stream barry you stealing my picks

54:14

all right mac stkl sgms all right all right yeah okay

54:20

we'll we'll check those out when we come across from the chat maybe we finish that up today i remember we on like page five or something

54:26

um but what do i want to do i said let me just check yeah okay so we're at 753 okay okay okay

54:31

let's just check some inside of buying this is kind of like we're in a little bit of a daily routine type thing here

54:37

okay lionsgate oh yeah what's this doing that was a um

54:43

abrams was that an abrams position as well in fact you know what i didn't check i

54:49

want to check abram's portfolio abrams i believe used to work at bao post and he was the one

54:54

invested alongside me in camping world a a slightly larger position in camping

55:00

world uh wait where is he is this camping world oh yeah some of these some of the

55:07

sometimes it doesn't work right because i think they change the tickers or something but um

55:12

i just want to see he's a good value investor

55:18

i think i actually you can't find much about those those bow post folks you know what i mean except

55:23

i couldn't find much about this guy i looked at it i looked into his background oh yeah wait led no that's lithium motors that ain't

55:30

it must be someone else i'm thinking of who was the one that went heavy into lionsgate

55:39

someone did was it that was it that guy who owns um

55:46

mhrs this guy this guy owns twi he was uh i believe a carl icon acolyte

55:53

not acolyte um i think he worked i think he worked with him and navistar he owns yep oh twi damn did

55:59

i i said twi right yeah now start too he's kind of just hold he just holds these positions i don't even

56:05

know what he i don't even know if he's managing money or anything like that i just looked into his background

56:11

and i believe he was associated with carl icahn anyway it's a little bit of a tangent there i just

56:16

just a couple of positions overlapped um fpi

56:21

ufi 150k there you go ah it's at 14. dude we're just looking

56:29

at that one everything's popping oh okay oh it's not

56:36

a 14. okay good oh it kissed 14.

56:44

yeah i remember we're talking about it'd be nice to buy it back under 10 but there was a good there was a solid margin of safety there

56:50

didn't we say didn't we say let me just see the chart and i might drag my memory

56:58

well i think we said 20 to 30 and i think there's like book value of like 24 or something like that

57:03

maybe it was low 30s i'm basing this on book i i mean i'm looking at the chart right

57:09

but sometimes seeing the chart jogs my memory as to which fundamentals i was looking at

57:14

i want to say it has book value in the low 20s in a history of earnings and value i got involved and they were

57:19

trying to turn around the business and historical earnings were like a dollar and change or something like that

57:24

so i could see it i could see it a multiple being applied to that too and

57:29

given the strength of the balance sheet i want to say like maybe 25 to 35 i think that's what i said so this is still somewhat cheap not screaming cheap

57:36

but still cheap and i believe minimal downside that's right that's the big thing asymmetric asymmetric returns right i'm not exactly

57:42

sure the upside or and i care about how much the upside is like in the case of sand ridge it could be 5x could be

57:47

well it could be 10x in theory i mean if carl was buying a 15 by the way it could be worth 30 right um that's not a major part of the thesis

57:54

major part of the thesis is it's got its ass kicked and it looks like there's minimal downside from here and if the upside can happen that'll be

58:00

big so same thing with like a ufi as i recall that i mean this was temporary this drawdown right it's just paper

58:06

losses but uh minimal fundamental minimal permanent downside so 12 bucks still not

58:12

bad i'd like it below 10 but um all right so 150k that's no joke

58:18

that's no joke ceo

58:24

it's not bad in kenneth leno it's a different person than uh lane going because he he was buying a ton

58:30

yeah look at this he was buying a ton oh it was mostly him okay so this is meaningful then see it was mostly this dude oh my god

58:37

same dude like um maybe he's got a screw loose or something i'm kidding i'm kidding don't get it but still but like

58:42

maybe i'm like maybe he's biased or something like that maybe he's he's got a vendetta to buy the stock or something like that who knows i don't know the

58:48

person's background i'm not knocking you can't atlanta but i'm just saying it's meaningful when someone else buys the stock for a change

58:54

especially when it's the ceo and it's his first purchase too look at that is it his first purchase

59:04

his name man open inside is great so basic just gets the job done you know what i

59:10

mean it's sick thank you open insider thank you

59:15

so is he a new ceo because if he's a new ceo maybe he he had to buy it you know what i mean that's a

59:20

then it becomes a little bit less um unify

59:27

there you go i mean april 2020 that's the thing if it's a

59:34

new you just you just took over the reigns or you're a new director or something i'm not saying it doesn't matter i'm

59:39

just saying it means less that's all i'm saying

59:44

um eddie engel as ceo and member of the board of the directors effective july 1st

59:50

spent 30 years who did did he have uh oh if he these in the uh investors uh value act

59:57

and whomever there's someone else involved with it too who else let's pull it up this is good now we have like fresh updated fun data that's nice

1:00:03

fresh june 30th but you catch my draft impala that name kind of sounds familiar

1:00:10

there you go kind of like oh that guy wants eight percent oh that's no joke didn't we look him up

1:00:18

yeah yeah yeah he's a billionaire but what's his background oh home deputy founded home depot that's right i mean i don't know

1:00:26

did you say anything on unify board of directors independent director meh i don't know sometimes it's nice

1:00:32

remember that remember that dbi story um um dsw that i like that story remember

1:00:37

that billionaire american eagle then here and then he was buying way higher prices like there's the story there there's an

1:00:43

error and so it's good to google the person's name sometimes and just see what their background is what their history is

1:00:49

in the in markets in this in the specific company think about when they were buying it back in the day with the

1:00:55

with the portfolio with the balance sheet what the company looked like at that time has this change has it's fundamentally

1:01:00

changed underneath the hood um so but here i don't have much

1:01:06

he's wounded by eight percent that's like that's some high conviction but um other than value act owns seven

1:01:12

eight percent so this is the thing the activists will get involved like like carl i'm gonna make a comparison to sandwich here

1:01:18

and then they'll shake things up they kind of gonna write letters bang like bang their fists on the table

1:01:24

i try to get people's attention make some moves and that can take 12 18 months it happened with gamestop too

1:01:29

um and um it just takes time for these to unfold but so someone like the ceo i'm gonna

1:01:35

assume that the activists like had to say had i don't know if they had control but they probably if they're still alone and

1:01:40

they probably picked him and so it's a good it's a good um a thing that the ceo changed in

1:01:45

april that's all and that means that the changes it doesn't mean it's always going to work out i'm not saying that just because they put in the ceo that the stock's

1:01:51

gonna work out it's gonna rise i'm certainly not saying that you still see mistakes but at least the narrative is still

1:01:56

intact you know what i mean like that narrative is so important um for a thesis for whether or not it's gonna work out and

1:02:02

um and we're seeing the ceo change and not so much the buying the shares just seeing the ceo change

1:02:08

speaks to the fact that it might be unfolding as they hoped uh valiant didn't change their position

1:02:14

in my with all that's going on so this is the thing this is a really important this is a really important um 13 f's

1:02:21

that we're seeing because this was a big it's also a great b because so much was going on right things were up things were down

1:02:27

so much uncertainty it's like where did people put their trips down i know it's only as of june 30th but still that's what i mean it would have been perfect

1:02:33

if it was like if you had march and then april and then they filed their 13 f's like maybe march 31st i don't know oh we do

1:02:40

have the ones for march 31st excuse me so that was a big one too oh that one might have been bigger that

1:02:46

one might have been bigger i don't know it's a tough call so the march 31st one was big because because we're still only a week out and they're

1:02:52

like i don't know we need some we need some safe secure assets and stuff but then the next one april may june it's like all right things what's going

1:02:57

on here things are restable things are stabilizing about what to do now and i see a lot more funds are diversified like you see barry with a

1:03:04

ton of positions for himself i think i saw einhorn with a ton of positions we didn't even get through all of them on friday which is exciting

1:03:09

because now there's so many more companies to look through but um anyway value act didn't change their position with all with all that's

1:03:15

going on that's telling right i mean you want to sell the garbage not this is a weird case because they're

1:03:20

activists you know what i mean they probably followed 13 d's but oh no 13 yes they're passive activists oh my bad

1:03:26

but um still with all that's going on just sell just sell your dogs not dog but just sell positions you don't

1:03:32

want and if you still held that's conviction you know what i mean value act has conviction it's their 20th

1:03:37

it's their 20th largest position in the portfolio not a huge position but real money 18

1:03:43

million dollars and um i forget how big their fund is so but still you get you get what i'm saying you get

1:03:49

what i'm saying i don't know impala i don't care to dig into this right now but there's some funds getting inclusive

1:03:54

these look like unique hedge funds like it's not just like blackrock and and

1:03:59

dimensional and vanguard and all that stuff looks like funds are trying to make some moves they got some good sized positions too eight

1:04:04

percent this guy's got eight percent so i like i do like ufi 12 bucks i do that's why we had that

1:04:10

note in there did i say add to ufi whatever it doesn't

1:04:15

matter oh but we saw the insider buying but right now we just looked ah it still it still matters but okay let's

1:04:22

keep going i think i saw i looked quickly i thought i saw some things oh flex

1:04:28

remember we're looking at fp and we said well let's see if we're gonna add let's just see if that dvorak and howard buys and there he goes he's

1:04:33

doing it again like clockwork like the follow the earnings file the earnings and then they

1:04:39

he starts he starts buying his shares um has he said anything new probably not there's been so much going on but

1:04:45

this is one of those really small let me pull up the chart oh there it is another reason open insider is good i

1:04:50

wish i had this in the uh spreadsheets but now i need i need more i doesn't have enough flexibility

1:04:57

this could be this is a super small cap company i think they like you can rent some of their products it reminds me a little bit of like uh like an errands

1:05:04

type thing where you can rent products is it rent i think it's rent

1:05:09

did i still not add the profile to this uh but like um it's one of those ones that

1:05:14

it could be a growth type company over time i don't it's not a super high conviction play but i was looking in march and april i came across this in uh march and april

1:05:22

i was looking a lot of small cap companies being like all right are there any potential ten beggars in just the small cap companies and ones that are gonna survive and it

1:05:28

looked like it was gonna survive at least to own in particular but it's like a web-based type thing look kind of interesting it

1:05:34

looked like you know what i mean like i'm i have no clue i have i'm no expert on this but i just think all right i don't know

1:05:40

if the business is going um if it's a horse and buggy industry it doesn't seem like that i don't know if

1:05:45

they have any edge but it seems like there could be something there you know what a similar company to this is is um parts this turned out to be a

1:05:51

great stock pick which i did not fully capture this gain so that sucked um but uh

1:05:58

so if you look at parts right they um i was getting involved i had great

1:06:03

timing on it real lucky i didn't didn't capture this full return just to be clear this is incredible this run and um

1:06:09

uh this was a missed opportunity i've i've written prts missed opportunities so many i've written like five times i legit remember

1:06:15

oh let's get back to today's because it was one of those ones i was literally invested in

1:06:21

oh i didn't add i keep on telling you i'm gonna add i need to add a separate note for missed opportunities can i do

1:06:27

that right now is that okay

1:06:35

i don't know i'll just do some bullet points here i'll go through i'll add them later i won't bore you to death right now what was it uh let's just do

1:06:41

parts um and i should write a little bit of narrative i didn't get time for that let's go

1:06:46

i'll just tell you it was like they got like um um oh you can order auto parts online right but like you can order auto parts

1:06:53

anywhere and then goes oh amazon's gonna just dominate that industry and this it's got no way just get no nothing it's like yeah but if you like they have they're

1:06:59

one of the top searches and there was a good presentation put together by some of the investors who would get involved or even by ownership themselves

1:07:04

that was like no people people shop here there's there's interest here and um i don't feel like getting into the narrative but i'm like all right that's

1:07:10

an industry it's like there's there could be something there i don't really know if they have an edge and it appeared as though the number of clicks they were getting were declining over

1:07:16

time but they were trying to shake things up remember that allen weber guy or alan weber i think he was getting involved he might even be on the board

1:07:23

he might be on the board which wait no no no it wasn't him no it was um

1:07:29

it was um a different smaller investor

1:07:36

who was it ah what was their name

1:07:42

oh i can't remember but then he got he got on the board and everything like that and there's it was that narrative i'm like oh they're going

1:07:47

to do it they're going to pull it off i i definitely did not think it was going to be when i started a buck i did not think 10

1:07:55

bag i thought it could be i was like five bucks that's i thought that was the upside and then it got up to like two bucks and then it sold off with all this but this was my missed

1:08:01

opportunity the trend was looking this look this trend look really good i'm like boom settle boom settle boom set right this

1:08:08

looks really good and if you were tracking the fundamental events and they were even buying shares the whole way up damn

1:08:16

i'll find his name david can't david connect oh now he's selling off see nice oh even he well he's trimming he didn't he's not out totally still loans quite a

1:08:22

bit but uh him he i thought he was a smaller investor for he googled his name he has

1:08:28

a founder i can't remember but look it you just look at this insider buy all that adult he was crushing it and i was watching that and

1:08:33

this was got my attention make no mistake about it um he bought you buying in late 2018

1:08:39

serious money to 2 million dollars i remember looking it looked like a smaller fund or whatever it was i'm like oh

1:08:44

and then look they just kept on going a dollar a dollar 20. they kept on going this whole damn time and then i think they got control of the board or

1:08:50

something and i can't remember but anyway and i thought all right because i was thinking four or five bucks upside i'm like ah

1:08:57

um there's i'm not going to add on the way up or anything like that and um was that damn chart and then they

1:09:04

sold off and it did they buy did they buy during the sell-off because that would have been painful oh they did no wait

1:09:13

no they didn't not that much this is all there was this no this is for this is noise so they didn't buy much

1:09:19

but they had just bought a dollar eighty and how far did it get down dollar eighty damn you see what i mean if you're tracking this stuff you see

1:09:25

that this this dude who at this time um at this time i think he was like

1:09:30

entrenched he was part of the company yeah director he's a director and had 10 percent maybe he was just a director i can't remember

1:09:36

and he was still buying at a dollar sixty a dollar eighty right serious money too almost a million bucks um and then we get back down there it

1:09:43

pulls back there it doesn't mean it doesn't mean it's always going to work out but that's a green flag to you

1:09:48

um and i didn't i didn't i didn't get it on this i didn't get it on the upswing

1:09:54

and so that's why it's missed opportunity you know what i mean how much am i how much of my damn streams are me lamenting missed opportunities no good

1:09:59

thing i have this beer jeez no big deal right learning experience and then we get better this is um

1:10:06

we'll be able to connect on this stuff with this stream you know what i mean we're already doing a better job tracking this stuff even hopping on this stream

1:10:13

three days a week it should be more frequently maybe we'll see all right let me close out of some stuff

1:10:21

why was i talking about prts i don't remember oh because of fpay so there's not it's not it's not the same story but

1:10:27

i brought that up because of the industry you know what i mean i just closed out of that but it's like yeah there could be something there i don't know um

1:10:34

and oh you know that one more thing in that prts and this is one of those uh just uh anecdotal stories but i was

1:10:41

getting my car fixed at um at a mechanic i can't remember for sure i hope i'm not making this story like if i convince

1:10:46

myself of this memory but i remember he was ordering auto parts i could see his computer and stuff and he was like i just got to order this

1:10:51

part and i believe it was one of the websites that prts owns

1:10:57

there's like a handful of uh very commonly uh every common auto part name is that here now i'm just curious but

1:11:03

google it like if you google like auto parts or something like that it's like they own one of those more common popular websites

1:11:09

there you go carpars.com jc whitney auto parts warehouse and i i'm pretty sure i can't remember i

1:11:15

was but he was ordering for one of those parts i think it was carpartz.com let me see if i started i might um

1:11:26

isn't that kind of funny like yeah you you see those things in real life right i'm not really i don't think it was this

1:11:31

oh it might have been i can't remember okay now now i'm definitely going off on tangents you know my bad

1:11:36

okay so it could be something that with fp that's not a meaningful buy it just seems like he's still got his story going there and um i i'm kind of

1:11:43

watching the chart on this it could be a buy right now um how's it look like again sorry just

1:11:49

one more time oh i didn't remember it sold the side look how look how thinly traded it is

1:11:55

that's not really my cup of tea you know i uh i like a little bit of

1:12:00

volume and stuff because that's just there's money to be made in a liquid stocks right every that's part

1:12:06

that's an edge for a lot of people i get that so it's not really for me look at this look at these candlesticks

1:12:11

i love seeing those kennels so it's like what the hell um ah this is probably a buy to be

1:12:17

honest look at this trend look at this trend right through february too this is a buy

1:12:22

what am i saying this is a buy i gotta add to this there you go

1:12:34

excuse me it's stuck in my head you believe that uh i'm gonna add to it what what i don't

1:12:40

even remember what size it is in the portfolio it should be how did we come across oh we came across this in here

1:12:50

point two percent so it's real small right no big deal 35 million i mean that's 10 bagger

1:12:56

potential you see 35 million but uh the fundamentals you know i'll pull it up

1:13:02

but um six months look at this so look at this column right here see this six month value can you see

1:13:08

that i'm not blocking it right oh i gotta get in the habit of scrolling up for you sorry about that when it's low on the screen i know i'm blocking some

1:13:14

of it so i'll scroll up so you can at least see my bad i'll get there i'll get there believe in me believe in me

1:13:20

f pay um this column right here so six months about 1.7 million oh i mean i i know it's a recurring

1:13:26

these are recurring purchases but i i start to lose track of how much they're adding up to what because look at this so look at

1:13:33

that okay okay so may 1.20 243 000 he upped it

1:13:38

10 wait a second oh we were looking at parts here you go we're looking at parts forget parts

1:13:44

parts is behind us now let's look at fp and look he was pulling the trigger quite a bit

1:13:49

in march all the way down so i i definitely remember this is why i remember i said i was looking a lot of companies marching i was going to small

1:13:55

cup stuff but i noticed the buying right you see i'm looking at the buying i was probably more that i definitely did go through every damn company every small cap i

1:14:02

went through every single company looking at the chart pulling up profile and stuff every single one that's in my spreadsheet i went i looked at but

1:14:08

i gave higher um press or higher value to companies that insider buying and obviously this one had a shit-ton which

1:14:14

looked weird but then i dug into it and i don't remember the full story but look at this um

1:14:19

march 5th so he's been buying the whole time make no mistake right but then they didn't buy much you bought a little bit about 200k in september and then

1:14:26

november then but then nothing but then march started happening then he's like all right let's do this boom 400k 100k oh that's the ceo

1:14:34

good that's someone different another 100k crush it into march here we go this is definitely an ad definitely an ad i just forgot

1:14:42

100k in march 31st 200k may 12th

1:14:48

okay who's this um i give that i think i said this in the last stream

1:14:54

sales during this quarter no big deal unless it's it just depends on the for the most part someone's selling in the quarter you cannot i can't blame

1:15:00

anyone i can't hold it against the company um um

1:15:07

and then june june june and this all adds up wow so to me so this was good because i saw these small purchases and really i only

1:15:13

saw above the red i was looking at it quick but if i kept on digging like i did for parts looking back down there but this is why the

1:15:19

spreadsheet's good you know what i mean like it was it was in here and it got my attention

1:15:24

1.7 million is for for if the company is only 36 million did we say 35 million market

1:15:31

cap holy right

1:15:41

1.7 million on 35 million and it was even it was even smaller than that right because of uh i mean it's up 50 it's up 60 it's up 60 of the

1:15:48

low so it was below was it below 20 million and they spent one point so they believed in it check out he had didn't he that guy had

1:15:55

done a um what was the full name of the company flex shopper

1:16:02

there was an interview with him was this it no no that's uh and so he he's on the board of directors

1:16:08

so he's he's invested in the comment damn um this is a good thing to do too like for the more so for these smaller type

1:16:14

companies you're like what the hell you're like what the hell is going on with this company you know what i mean like you have you have those questions a lot with

1:16:19

with um small companies 35 million these are really small companies because they're not

1:16:24

there's there's less stringent filing requirements and they're just new and not that many people follow them blah blah blah i i legit will come

1:16:31

across like i don't what the hell is going on here what do they do what's the edge that they have let me try this and so i'll legit just

1:16:38

google i could have sworn it came across something investigations into businesses

1:16:45

linked to debt relief advocate 2016 is a prominent navigator for debt relief for american interviews

1:16:51

as you can said he isn't in the payday line all right so that what's that i'm not going to read that right now that one's this type of thing this is what i did

1:16:57

with sandridge by the way so when you come across a company and and you're trying to get piece that sort of you just do a google search sandwich call

1:17:02

icon um whatever it is once you start piecing together you know it's like a puzzle you stop searching for those different

1:17:08

puzzle pieces and looking for something else and you just do google it's great oh and google's a good

1:17:14

good company too right you saw it was uh it's now barry's largest position via those call options right i know people saying like ah he's buying

1:17:21

call options to google a huge position but he almost certainly bought him in april and just he just did a great job time and it just it's probably up 10x

1:17:27

but um i don't i don't have a wall street journal individual invest maybe someday i'll get it right i

1:17:33

uh it just doesn't add that much to my research process i don't know i know a lot of people like it and stuff

1:17:38

okay what's this uh this isn't it but you this is good to read why when they're appointed so that

1:17:44

comes up too that's a press release but what the hell uh have you come a girl oh no that's not it i definitely

1:17:51

read an interview can't remember oh is this it what's this

1:17:59

no that's not it oh well it doesn't matter i'll dig in

1:18:05

but i remember reading it and i remember thinking oh this guy really believes in it doesn't mean he's right but he's like

1:18:10

he's not in it just like trying to make some money he's like no this could be something here and uh i remember reading oh maybe i should

1:18:16

1:19:40

what that is and now it's like oh it's for us but you never knew what it was growing up

1:19:46

1:20:38

1:21:04

that duvor can ha man i could have sworn it was to work in hour but

1:21:10

maybe it was one of these maybe it was one of these guys i'm not gonna go looking forward if you find it shoot it over it's not

1:21:15

that big of a deal i've seen enough i've seen enough to add to it let's just pull the fundamentals real quick do i got it in here

1:21:22

fp it's not super compelling as i recall but it was compelling enough it didn't look dire like yeah here you

1:21:28

go you get tangible book value of 50 cents you know what i mean i was trading at a buck that was what i was buying when it

1:21:34

was a buck look at look at these revenues huh oh small companies but look at the

1:21:40

growth no joke so i'm value investor right but i'll i mean this isn't this isn't

1:21:46

necessarily a growth type stuff but i see this i'm like hey all right uh maybe i'll deal on a growth type company for a

1:21:51

change i know it's still it's still small super speculative but it's growing you know what i mean often companies i'm dealing with

1:21:57

especially small companies they're not growing that much or it's super volatile you see this i'm like oh this looks terrific

1:22:02

forget everything else it's like i'd like to see that and you see the share issuance this is them trying to grow right i have it lit up red because issue and

1:22:09

shares sometimes red flag but they're trying to grow you gotta you gotta raise capital issue shares raise debt whatever the hell it is

1:22:15

um so that's that's one thing that's stuck up to men and remember down gross margins is declining check

1:22:21

this out 47 42 35 not that great that's not good let's scroll over

1:22:28

oh why is this so thin 33 all right so it's up year over year though that ain't bad that ain't bad for that quarter huh am i

1:22:34

crazy game stop uh gamestop increase their gross margin too which no one talks about right

1:22:40

uh okay let me go back oh look at this look at this look at

1:22:45

this ebitda per share look at this even though right i know everyone

1:22:50

critiques the out of it buff it and everyone and i we all get why they do it right

1:22:57

i said this on the other streams though it's something sometimes you have so little to go off of look how small this company is how are you going to value

1:23:03

this company what fundamentals are you going to base your thesis and so many people will see this and they're like all right moving

1:23:08

on to the next one and i'm like what this it could be an opportunity there i so i i hesitate to to just

1:23:15

i'm not going to pass on it just because i have to use ebitda as a way to as something to apply a multiple to like i

1:23:20

think all right so i see this i what i partially what i think is i think of it as an opportunity i think

1:23:26

i see all this red like remember this company looks like it's bleeding to death you know what i mean who wants to touch this look at these uh

1:23:31

i mean it's a young company that's right so but it looks like we like to see the purple and green and all that but this doesn't look good you first open up

1:23:37

but other that's what other people are seeing too in companies and stuff and institutions they think yeah whatever

1:23:43

not all of them i'm not saying that but i'm just like they might be overlooking some of this stuff so i see this ebitda

1:23:49

is this right because it was only five what is that

1:23:56

right three dollars an ebit though hold on what's ebitda where is it

1:24:08

right there 68 million in ebitda wait a second and it's growing too every

1:24:14

year 9 three thirty fifty three sixty at least it's following revenue i know it's ebitda i get it

1:24:19

so because it's eba it should be discount a little bit but it shouldn't be overlooked and i feel like people do all right sick eps forget about it look

1:24:27

at this terrible earnings right um that sucks they finally just turned to positive operating cash flow ding

1:24:33

ding ding you know what i mean uh if you you know i hate the negative operating cash flow cash burn

1:24:38

you gotta finance that somehow they'll eat at the very least you gotta stabilize your

1:24:44

your key your i mean free cash flow generation excuse me at the very least but start with operating casual and it just

1:24:50

turned positive excuse me so we would dig in to see if it's sustainable and all that i'll

1:24:56

get there i don't think but even but positive simple free cash flow look at this um simple free cash flow per share

1:25:03

26 cents so like we see we see red all the way up to here but 26 cents divide oh well i have the um this is a

1:25:11

simple free cash flow to price that's a free cash flow yield of 16 that's not bad you know what i mean i

1:25:16

mean talk about earnings yield and simple free cash flow yield right those are common common terms in in the industry and um

1:25:23

like oh would you rather put your money in the bank account and earn one percent or would you rather earn this earnings yield right i mean this is kind of

1:25:28

kind of like that it's like 16 for casualty that's not super cheap to be honest but it's still

1:25:34

surprising that it's even has a positive support for casual yield i guess um so there's things

1:25:42

you can find some good things in this stuff right but i um this isn't uh it's not confirmation bias

1:25:48

or anything like i have the context of this is speculative this is super small maybe this growth is going to maybe it

1:25:53

has reached its maximum growth potential i have no idea what the upside is what you would do is

1:26:00

you'd go to the website and this is where these types of presentations can be really helpful you'll go to the website you go to investor relations

1:26:08

and you want to put what the hell is this oh this isn't the website

1:26:17

you go to the website you pull up if they have an investor presentation this is the type of company where it's like all right i need some

1:26:23

look at this website this is t-flex's birthday week

1:26:29

savings up to 55 look at this huh what the hell that's funny lenovo monitor's a sec look

1:26:37

at this huh it's good to just mess around with the websites too i i don't do it that much but kind of kind of cool to check out like um like

1:26:44

people look at this stuff you know what i mean they have almost 100 million in revenue so people do this i don't do it but it's kind of interesting to be like all right people checking this out

1:26:51

uh leasing it to own like people live this way they do um and for some people it it it can help

1:26:57

them it can it gives them access to some of these types of things and so but whether or not there's legitimate growth potential out there

1:27:04

you can't just tell by looking at the website and stuff that's why i don't do it as much because i don't want to mislead myself

1:27:09

you know what i mean what if this was like super cool and super catchy i'm like oh this this is going to be really sick i don't want to deceive myself

1:27:16

um but i can understand like all right this is a legitimate thing that people will check out here just to lease some

1:27:22

of their stuff ah there's any presentation or anything oh here you go events and presentation this is the thing we might not have something up to date

1:27:28

oh they got one sick okay sick all right let's do it omni

1:27:35

channel lease to own that's what i mean i think they might uh they could have a little bit of an edge there

1:27:40

if they get some some legitimate omni channel experience i mean they got a picture of a phone and

1:27:45

a laptop that's pretty good i don't know the games i'm trying to do there i'm everything i talk about

1:27:50

everything i tie back to gamestop huh it's just i've been looking at the very similar stuff all across the board we facilitate both sides of the

1:27:56

consumers blah blah blah for consumer well i won't go through this presentation right although maybe i should i mean i'm talking about adding

1:28:01

should i had big that's what i would i would look we give non-prime customers immediate purchasing

1:28:07

power for what they want put it is simple you just hope it's not um i don't know what the interest rate would be

1:28:12

but i know it's it's a tough it's a tough industry in that regard

1:28:18

we increased their sales with number we increased their sales with for retailers we increased those with non-prime retail customers

1:28:23

who do not qualify for traditional credit you know what i mean it's lower credit people yeah i'm always got to be careful with those types of companies

1:28:30

i had forgotten this aspect that it's um non-prime i mean that tends to be people who were doing the lease to own anyway so i guess

1:28:36

i mean it's not totally lost on me but um that there it's slide two you know what i mean it's front and center

1:28:41

it's prominent there's another company out there oh is it con was it c-o-n-n

1:28:47

that um this is one of those earnings shenanigans right where you get you goose up revenues and you

1:28:52

get more revenues but it's just because you're extending credit to everybody just like yeah here you go you can buy this yeah we'll just give you a credit card we just give you credit give you

1:28:58

credit and so revenues are rising but you also see accounts receivables going up as well

1:29:03

because you're just giving people the credit and then you start seeing them factor the receivables where they sell receivables to other people

1:29:09

and so it starts that's it's i don't love i don't love this business model because um

1:29:17

yeah i don't know i uh it can be tough also it's yeah i don't know it's just a tough it's

1:29:22

a tough business model because it when if the non-prime people they get hit hard too like this is interesting like and maybe let's check out khan too so if

1:29:30

their non-prime customers are getting hit oh look at this so it chilled ah but it bounced back nicely

1:29:36

they tend to be super cyclical like they get cr this is called this is a proxy for f pay big in 2006 economy's boom and

1:29:42

everything's doing well then we hit recession it goes from i don't think it ever paid a dividend but let me just adjust it in case it did

1:29:50

went from dollars to three dollars you know what i mean and then it goes from three dollars then

1:29:55

we're in 2013 this is where small caps were crushing and everything like that 77 and then we get hit into the um 2015

1:30:02

2016 and then it comes back down to six dollars seven dollars 45 you see what i mean so it's super

1:30:08

cyclical and um your customers if they're if the customers are struggling this is what i

1:30:14

mean it's interesting to see it bounce back so strongly but that's because consumer discretionaries bounce back and

1:30:19

consumers have bounced back but still um you should expect to sell off if if your non-prime customers are getting

1:30:24

whacked and it's it's sad to say but i think some of them are right now so it's actually kind of impressive that fp's holding up that

1:30:31

well but i don't know it's it's more complex than that i'm just trying to huge rules of thumbs it's

1:30:36

a lot more goes into it than that but anyway let's get back to the presentation i just my point just being i

1:30:41

i don't this isn't my typical area of expertise large addressable virtual lease to own

1:30:47

market opportunity for over 60 years customers went to physical lto store locations

1:30:52

right okay this is what i mean so if there's an edge here it's because they're online and i don't know they're growing right now but how hard

1:30:58

is it for another at least to own type firm to just turn the spigot on of just improve their omni channel experience and people will go

1:31:04

there instead but nevertheless okay so we know it's a huge market 25 billion that's helpful

1:31:10

um just good to know because i don't know the i don't know the market that well the only omnichannel lto provider is

1:31:17

that true nah that can't be true right patented payment method

1:31:24

what's this orange flex shopper has a payment option on retailer's commerce site b2c channel

1:31:32

in-store save the sale all right i mean i don't want to go through this whole presentation because uh this is

1:31:38

i just kind of wanted to get a feel for what the upside was which we saw 25 that's not the upside it's just hey this is a big market you know what i mean

1:31:45

52 week term lease to own product okay and it's all it's a lot of your typical

1:31:51

consumer things that people want

1:31:57

oh here you go customers want to lease a product value customer one times ac has secured least own purchasing option future value to f pay right because

1:32:03

they're going to pay it with interest payments and stuff assume customers utilize early payment option discounted value to have pay right

1:32:08

because they paid off really bad 30 you know what i mean ah 30 of their debt is bad debt that

1:32:16

there's it's just a tough it's tough to assess

1:32:24

and it's just risky that's all there's a business this is a business model this is how a lot of businesses function uh but look

1:32:30

at that right so this is what they do get if they get fully paid um but if they get paid if they get uh

1:32:37

paid early and then if only some only 70 of them pay back then that's the multiple that's how a lot of this stuff works i mean that's how um

1:32:44

any of these lenders if you go to uh there's some i think there's still some publicly traded like gold pawn shops what was that one i

1:32:50

forget the name of it um and to a degree isn't gamestop somewhat similar you know what i mean you trade in your your games and and um

1:32:56

it's not quite the same it's not it's not quite the same what i mean but it's like a fraction of uh that's not the same at all but i just

1:33:02

mean when you see people trading in stuff or whatever or trying to borrow stuff and then that you're looking at the multiples of

1:33:08

as to what you can get for it's not really the same thing but when i'm thinking multiples thinking that's that comes to mind um

1:33:15

okay thirty percent ah is that on average i wonder if that's typical

1:33:21

thirty percent on average but on a downturn jesus i i kind of surprised it held up as well as it did interesting

1:33:30

but that trend looked good before okay the question i'm just trying to figure out is do i go a little bit heavier in this

1:33:37

you know what i mean i don't know gross lease origination net revenues

1:33:46

bouncing up nice acquisition costs their acquisition costs are going down according to them i've adjusted ebitda bouncing all around

1:33:55

adjusted even the last 12 months 8 million wait what is that what we saw

1:34:01

wait a second this would make more right doesn't that seem super high is this a

1:34:06

mistake is this last 12 months this would make a

1:34:14

lot more sense right yeah okay that makes more sense you know what i mean two q is it what's held

1:34:20

last 12 months through 2q 2020 right that's how i'm interpreting this 12 months into june 30th 2020

1:34:28

which means these numbers are wrong so what i mean suck um

1:34:37

suck not because of the company but because these these damn this is the life of um uh individual investor you

1:34:43

know what i mean that's a bummer is it wrong why is that why is that

1:34:48

wrong like that 68 66 is it

1:34:54

because it's most recent 12 months yeah that i don't know is that is there an error there i don't know all right they got to look into that

1:35:00

what are we doing let's just do this ah bummer i mean now it's a little bit less it's less compelling now right when i saw

1:35:06

that i'm like what the hell 68 million in ebitda at a 38 million 35

1:35:12

million market cap that don't make no sense

1:35:18

income statement okay six months senate what do you get for uh operating income two million yeah

1:35:24

okay all right so yeah the spreadsheet's wrong you're good we're going to see that more often with

1:35:30

smaller companies like this just because however they're doing it on their end it's um trying to collect the data and

1:35:36

stuff it gets messy um and so you hit errors and stuff like that i don't even know what the issue is clearly that's the data that's getting

1:35:42

pulled in for the last 12 months i don't know what to say but um let's go say i'm glad we did check up on that huh

1:35:50

eight million in ebitda so ev does it have debt oh we got it open

1:35:59

let's check does that debt it has i mean a different type of debt right but a traditional debt

1:36:07

it's a related party some but not much okay all right this isn't a go heavy then this isn't going that's okay

1:36:13

no brick and mortar stores or inventory right so this is a plus you know what i mean it was the same thing with uh

1:36:19

i think parts too like there's no store or anything it's just they have this online presence where they can do stuff that you can have a high return on

1:36:24

capital with those types of companies there you go asset level irs you see what i mean figure their claim at 100

1:36:30

200 plus thousand plus items highly repeat customer base i vaguely remember reading that lower

1:36:35

customer acquisition cost expand base of repeat customers heavily promote mobile

1:36:41

integrationless in-store stuff all right oh let's just check these real quick

1:36:46

they'll probably report an ebitda figure pre-marketing ebitda

1:36:52

yeah okay so it's it's much smaller but if it can keep growing they're growing with a company like this

1:36:57

it's the revenue growth that's arguably most important because you know it's you're not so much trying to turn a profit well you i mean ideally you are

1:37:03

for someone like me but you're just trying to grow

1:37:11

all right there's nothing really else to check it's just uh it's got some it's got some

1:37:17

potential growth opportunity the insiders are buying they um and there's i mean there's some

1:37:23

there's at least positive ebitda on a market cap of what do what do we

1:37:29

actually actually can we actually see

1:37:36

they have it maybe have an uh ev to ebitda figure right then they have an enterprise value of 79 million

1:37:43

that's not that cheap so it's not that cheap you know what i

1:37:48

mean ebitda of what do we say 8 million

1:37:55

okay well i'm glad we looked this up actually 8 million last 12 months but it's tough

1:38:00

but if they keep growing that's the thing then um and if they pay off debt that's going to keep declining and stuff okay

1:38:06

all right i'm still going to say add to it did i say add to it yeah add fpa cool because i think it's one of the smaller positions in the portfolio

1:38:15

yeah 0.26 yeah we'll bump that up we'll bump that up it's never going to be super heavy though but

1:38:22

we'll see does anyone own it sorry i meant to check this

1:38:40

peta holdings don't know emerson don't know perkins capital bigger capital don't know and nobody so

1:38:46

that's not helping things and i did look at the art there were some there were some decent articles out

1:38:51

at the time actually probably still some out there yeah david oh he was very bullish yeah i vaguely remember that

1:38:59

asymmetric nano kept that there you go so i'd like to see this

1:39:05

ah didn't he hadn't he sold out or something i definitely read this i've read his i've read some of his

1:39:11

articles before he's um continued buying uh similar stuff last

1:39:16

quarter's beaten increased ebitda better got him so this was in december and let me just jump to his conclusions

1:39:23

what was he saying oh good there's some commentary on there down there too news came out the upside could be six

1:39:30

dollars compared to my original guest all right so there you go it's helpful midpoint moves from two dollars to 350 yeah

1:39:35

so yeah well that roughly would have been my upside right i mean it could it could be 10 bagger but that's not

1:39:42

this isn't the type of play where i'm playing for a ten bagger i see the growth and i think they could grow ebitda and then once

1:39:47

it gets repriced i would say four to six oh that's what he says four to six i was just gonna say four six like i'm

1:39:53

stealing his idea but um just based on uh the equity and what that ebitda could be

1:39:59

um or free cash flow two if they can actually keep that going where they get 25 cents

1:40:05

is that what we were saying get it to 50 cents or a dollar or something like that yeah we'll se it's still uh

1:40:11

it's ad we'll see what happens with it i don't know i just don't know enough to know whether or not i could be five ten beggars that's what i mean these growth

1:40:17

type companies i don't know and i'll never have super high conviction and it's tough

1:40:22

but we'll we'll keep tracking it that's a good thing cool all right add tech paper boom

1:40:28

uh where the hell were we oh yeah that was just funny because i'm pretty sure we just said that on like

1:40:33

friday or wednesday or something albertsons is that the supermarket yeah

1:40:39

it is all they just took them public i was invested in super value back in the day

1:40:44

got a got a solid um like four bag or a five bagger out of it remember it had serious cash flow and then but it had i

1:40:50

think it owned albertsons at a time but then they got i think they got bought out i forget i forget the story

1:40:57

hey vape more vapor therm buying i've been talking about that a lot

1:41:02

who's this oh that's that's got to be the same that's the same guy i bet he'll he's part of that fund that's

1:41:08

buying in would we say prescott prescott capital or something uh yeah i don't know i'm holding for now

1:41:15

i'm just seeing what the price is doing a little bit bearish at first but it's flattening out it's flat and i'll give a little bit more time i remember the first time we

1:41:21

saw that selloff i was like ah i messed up i should have tried i should have been trimming the only reason i didn't trim is

1:41:26

that's what i mean i this is why this stream is important i just wasn't paying attention

1:41:32

it was at 50 bucks i think i bought at 18 or something and uh oh it's almost a triple 1836

1:41:40

very close to it i had i don't think i trimmed i may have trimmed once but not not

1:41:45

because of business specific reason then sold off i was like i messed up if it weren't for that insider buying that prescott i would

1:41:51

i would have um sold out i would have eaten the loss it would have been like i messed up but um now there still could

1:41:57

be something there this is another case for i have no idea what the hell do i know about ventilators i don't know about ventilators i know that

1:42:03

there's been a lot more people talking about them and especially in march and april right that was why it was on my radar and um but the upside opportunity for

1:42:11

there is there i mean we saw they had tremendous revenue growth year over year um but what the hell do i

1:42:18

know i don't know so now i just i'm just looking reading the tea leaves right just looking at the things i usually look at and seeing if there could be something

1:42:23

there so we'll see what the price does i'm just holding for right now but i wasn't even thinking about adding it was never a big position but

1:42:35

oh i've definitely trimmed it's only 0.19 of the company i put the portfolio excuse me i've definitely trimmed i

1:42:41

didn't trim at about 40 bucks i might have maybe trimmed in 30. that's what i mean if there is oh it's

1:42:48

still 750 million dollar market cap that's that's kind of steep but well they keep buying huh they're not

1:42:55

they're not messing around they've been buying every damn day

1:43:04

10 million 3 million wow okay

1:43:12

oh the insiders were buying look at that they were buying late last year i just forgot i'm sure i saw it back in

1:43:18

march and april i'd like to see that okay keep my eye on that anything else

1:43:27

i think that was it man you see we inside are buying it's worth checking out because oh yeah more from we did see him all right that was it

1:43:32

because this was i remember seeing this um all weekend smhi that was the last

1:43:38

one cool okay let's keep going let's keep going what now what now

1:43:46

okay okay all right now we got some a little bit of flexibility so it's 8 42 we could finish off those charts we got

1:43:53

the let's do daily movers let's do daily movers i know i haven't been doing that every day so let's oh lxu's up 40

1:44:00

damn i definitely talked about that one on the stream how i kind of oh no oh

1:44:09

i may have talked about that on august 3rd oh

1:44:15

oh this chart looked fine too oh no oh no

1:44:22

oh i had written this one off i definitely said that during the stream of how i like i was i was in and in the day i hadn't followed the story

1:44:30

i hadn't followed the story but then i um whenever i talked about it didn't this chart look interesting look at this chart it's

1:44:35

clearly basing may july august it's like all right it's kind of settled down a bit and then it's

1:44:40

just like what's what's the next move you can oh i gotta pull up the fundamentals

1:44:46

you can kind of you can at least initiate a position based on that alone i i mean i do that

1:44:51

where if i see anything that catches my attention whether it's inside or buying or it doesn't matter i'll and i see this

1:44:57

chart i'm buying you know what i mean get it in the position get on the portfolio and then just track it and then it's a matter of um

1:45:03

if i'm going to add to it and turn it into a good sized position oh no i had written this off totally

1:45:10

look at the chart i'll tell you why i bought in here and i got a cool double

1:45:18

off of it i thought it was going to be more than a double they had they had two separate businesses which were always always weird it was like an hvac

1:45:24

business and um it's like was it a chemical business or something i think it was it's in the chemical industry i think those are the

1:45:29

two business models and then i was kind of just lumping around like this it was doing nothing and then i thought some funds got

1:45:34

involved and then i'm like i don't know what's going on here and then this trend happened then i just kept starting kept

1:45:40

on seeing it go down i'm like oh this is probably going to go bankrupt uh and it did look that way here for a bit right i

1:45:45

mean that's why it was go it had happened for so long it's been 12 months 12 months 12 months 12 months you know

1:45:51

what i mean that's what was in my head and i had just written it off that's why if you're part of a team you know you can

1:45:57

um just someone keeping the finger on the pulse just following the story you can't you can only follow so many stories at a time it's not about that

1:46:03

but the stock price is kind of a shortcut to that and so when we saw this base may june july

1:46:11

three months of stabilization i mean i never would have guessed 4x let's look at the fundamentals

1:46:21

let me just see i'm not i'm going to feel a lot less bad if it's not cheap based on some metric because

1:46:27

remember if i've if i've owned it in the past let's see this then i looked at it at some point and i

1:46:33

and i poured over the numbers and for whatever reason oh no oh look at the debt though you know what

1:46:38

i mean i was trading that it was checking out one buck on a wait a second what's the price right now is that price ah the price is out of

1:46:44

date look at this price 272. why the price is out of date

1:46:51

oh it's not totally out of date it was at 272 today at some point uh but i see a stock stock price of one

1:46:58

dollar and it was at seven dollars book value but look at the debt 25 dollars per share in book value

1:47:03

excuse me a net common overhang per share but ebitda is still positive

1:47:09

one dollar right just about one dollar what what would we have seen

1:47:14

you see the purple and green that's what had my attention back in 2016 20. look at the equity growth

1:47:20

you see what i mean forget this uh forget this actually 2016 too this is what i was looking at back in the day

1:47:27

and i saw the revenue growth and i saw the huge i saw the huge decline indicated it was a cyclical business and

1:47:32

that's why it was a big reason it sold off as much as it did it's back out 10 years

1:47:39

yeah it was trading at 40 bucks you know and i bought it at like five bucks i'm like whoa um of course it never got back

1:47:47

there but yeah i mean i bought about like five bucks so it had like book value like 20

1:47:52

bucks right but it had that of 18 bucks per share and um so that was why there was some debt concerns but look at the historical look

1:47:59

at those historical earnings too legitimate right through the uh right through the recession too

1:48:04

but then operating cash flow all right so operating cash flow wasn't much so it was really just the book value so this just i never would have been

1:48:11

it's the story that i'm more curious about you know what i mean so i never would have been super i never would have found this super

1:48:17

compelling just looking at this except in like a diversified play of just buying really cheap price to book um and where

1:48:24

a chart looks somewhat compelling but if we had pulled up the damn news releases you know what i mean

1:48:35

what there's no nude oh you're kidding me you're kidding me

1:48:40

there's no news in the past two weeks what's this based on

1:48:48

net sales of 105 is it six percent increase in agricultural sales volumes including has it spun off the other business maybe

1:48:54

it's already separated from the other business mark berman lsb industries presidency or

1:49:00

pricing remain an issue blah blah blah the nitrogen yeah so it was is it just did they sell off the hvac

1:49:05

business maybe they did that kind of sounds familiar which is not a bad thing

1:49:13

ah damn everything was down right what's going on here

1:49:24

i just want to know why i was up like some is it heavily shorted is it a short

1:49:29

squeeze it looks like a short squeeze doesn't this is what i imagine a short squeeze looks like you see the stair strap you see the stair

1:49:36

stopping it can happen in a matter of days it can happen over weeks but it's just like

1:49:41

major stair-stepping what is the uh

1:49:56

forty percent jeez

1:50:02

short percent of float what yeah i think it's a um um a tightly held company in that

1:50:08

there's not much float what's the float versus to the share no no yeah so there's only 30

1:50:14

million shares outstanding the float's only 20 million so what i mean it's it's kind of hard to short those companies but if it's not a short

1:50:22

squeeze did they have a really positive outlook cast vision was 56 million additionally

1:50:28

he had approximately 12 million total long-term debt including the current portion was 500 million at june 30 compared to 459 so it

1:50:35

went up the increase in long-term debt largely reflects the use of funds from our revolvers we preemptively borrowed on

1:50:40

the revolver all right well it's not a bad idea interest expense is there anything here

1:50:46

that would have triggered this what the hell

1:50:52

well i'm not seeing anything and i feel less bad you know because when i see all that debt that they have

1:50:57

i'm unless i'm like ah like i said i care more about the narrative there's no narrative here and

1:51:03

this is just getting bit up because market crazy market behavior i don't give a that's no better you can't feel bad

1:51:08

about that who cares what's this

1:51:24

hmm this is a poison pill

1:51:29

the the uh preferred stock purchase rights why would you do

1:51:35

here you go oh here it is poison pill there is shareholders rights plan that's a point you know what a poison pill is

1:51:41

they're trying to often it's used to prevent being taken over from someone trying to take a position

1:51:46

um so you um you do it preemptively to try if someone

1:51:52

starts taking a trying to get control of your company you can issue a whole bunch of preferred chairs with a ton of um

1:51:57

voting rights to kind of prevent it from happening but usually if you see this happening someone has expressed interest

1:52:03

or okay so here we go this is interesting but this was a month ago

1:52:08

this was a month ago or july something oh there you go july 6th to protect the availability of its net

1:52:14

operating losses okay right right i think i something if you get

1:52:22

depending on who has control of it there's something i forget off the top of my head but you can like lose access to the napa

1:52:27

operating losses so sometimes this is what they say to justify it whether or not it's legitimate i'm not i don't know whether or not they're

1:52:33

they're just saying this is the reason or i mean it makes sense that if you don't if you're

1:52:38

would you are they could they be actively marketing the company perceiving perceiving long-term shareholder value by adopting a rights

1:52:44

but intended to protect tax assets by reducing the like reducing the likelihood of an ownership change right

1:52:50

whiz one as defined by the yep rights plan in effect immediately will

1:52:56

be sub submitted for shareholder ratification at 2021 annual meeting did they say why had approximately 600

1:53:02

million in federal operating losses so that's clutch and um some companies these are really valuable assets i think

1:53:09

uh who else has some net operating like those knolls like those those those as long as you remain a

1:53:15

going concern you can continue to expect to generate profits in the future those have legitimate value because they're going to reduce the taxes that

1:53:21

you have to pay so it is important to protect those but um and those will be on the uh

1:53:27

in the 10k and and so forth those are in the footnotes those are assets that a lot of people i don't know that's i have no i can't

1:53:33

substantiate that but i think people tend to overlook but they're legitimate assets that um need to be taken into consideration

1:53:38

when trying to value the company when you're really doing a deep dive um i imagine some people overlook that's

1:53:44

what i think intended to reduce the likelihood of such an overture team when someone takes over five percent

1:53:49

interesting i wonder if they if someone had said something or if someone had started dabbling and that's why they did it

1:53:57

we'll initially trade with yellow speeds comma stock and will generally become exercisable only if a person acquired yeah it's impossible

1:54:02

but um no real info on it huh don't want anyone talking about it damn

1:54:08

the other thing i would do is this

1:54:20

although i doubt we're going to see much

1:54:27

i mean

1:54:34

yeah good call i love we love poc basses yeah uh that's what we're just talking about

1:54:40

here um we're not gonna see any now sometimes i look just to see if some people are talking about it

1:54:48

um

1:54:54

august 13th there's going to be lots of people talking about it too just because it was up 40 today you know what i mean these day traders so just say some can we get

1:55:00

back to her uh i'm not gonna i can't sort through this you know what i mean look i look at how far i just scrolled we're only three hours back just because it was such

1:55:06

it was up so much today but it's like oh that's that's not helpful for me yeah whatever don't waste our time all

1:55:12

right uh unless did i already write down oh good i didn't ah i don't

1:55:18

that's fine and also let's see if it comes crashing down you know what i mean if there's nothing backing it

1:55:25

weird no one said anything if you know anything about that yeah let me know or don't because then i don't i don't

1:55:32

have to i don't have to list it as a missed opportunity you know what i mean okay so 40 stein oh that's uh that's a bankrupt company that's

1:55:38

clear one oh yeah i looked at this one a while back

1:55:45

uh thinly traded no i don't want to look at that they do um microphone type

1:55:53

sure i don't know they're not sure they uh they they're a competitor i'm sure you

1:55:58

know sh you are like those microphone companies they do the clear one you may have you probably may know the name they do like um

1:56:04

voice communication type stuff but they were in a legal battle with i think it was sure but they were saying

1:56:10

like they stole their idea or something and uh it was in the courts and stuff and i try to figure out if there was going to be a

1:56:16

big big payday if they won but it was tough to damn overstock crushing it and that's the missed opportunity damn

1:56:23

let's pop the fundamentals on that one

1:56:28

it was a missed opportunity in march it should i should have just pulled the trigger um i think it's going to look cheap actually i remember looking at it i

1:56:34

remember looking at it last year and um

1:56:41

and now this is just absurd sorry did i just close out of the chart

1:56:48

look at this what was it 270 i mean who i would have never thought this huh oh

1:56:54

what even is this 118 let's call it uh let's call it three bucks

1:57:01

you never would have held this long you would have been trimming the whole way up right 40 baggers what and this what's this

1:57:08

what is this dragon cap uh i think this was a short squeeze too wasn't it i have enough oh my

1:57:16

five billion oh that's awesome huh

1:57:21

oh let's check these fundamentals that's incredible

1:57:28

wow that's impressive

1:57:38

oh what happened to it

1:57:43

oh i lost it oh there it is oh it's here okay so uh let me try to remember to

1:57:49

look at 1.8 billion in revenues legitimate company you know what i mean they're stumbling a little bit here and this was a big drop off but

1:57:56

not that much in the grand scheme of things um no debt right off the bat and i had seen

1:58:01

they had four dollars in cash that was 2018 i wasn't looking at it in 2018 i was definitely looking at in 2019 but no decent balance sheet you know what i

1:58:08

mean so it's just then it's just a guessing game on the business model um not less on a less credit analysis

1:58:14

required and then not much historical earnings so major major losses okay so not much and then

1:58:21

simple free cash flow they weren't generating much free cash flow but even still you're trading at um remember i was

1:58:26

looking at it in 2019 though too though there was a remember the ceo was involved with some like conspiracy

1:58:33

theory too i was looking at it right around here and then i was and then i figured i thought this was a

1:58:38

missed opportunity i'm like ah this looked good right here i thought it looked good at 10 bucks i definitely remember that but now i'm trying to see why i thought

1:58:45

that i mean i see this historical free cash flow rolling three oh that no that's one off

1:58:52

but average three year free cash flow of 75 cents that's not super cheap what the hell did i say i saw the revenues

1:58:58

gross margin hold and steady historical tangible equity growth excuse me tangible book

1:59:04

growth but um nothing crazy but was it

1:59:13

he wasn't he like trying to burn the shorts or something like that you remember that

1:59:18

he was like calling him out

1:59:24

okay so i saw 400k purchased back in may 2019 and then this purchase but that one had

1:59:30

it must have caught my attention oh that was him i think it this was i think this was the uh

1:59:36

former ceo or owner or something then he and then they either fired him or he left and then he's like well i'm selling everything then he got completely out

1:59:43

look check that i was like oh it's an odd story i kind of forget um all right this isn't as much did i

1:59:50

say it's a missed opportunity it's a little bit of a missed opportunity just because again when everything's selling off you just put the chips down on some

1:59:56

places and um these are legitimate revenues here and then it was trading at uh below book

2:00:02

so i mean a company like this trading below book it's not like a trading below book for an energy company you know what i mean it's trading below book for

2:00:10

um do i mean a different type of look at all this overbought figure but it's like a trainer below book for

2:00:16

it's a way to diversify the types of stocks that you're dealing in that are trading below book you know what i mean even if i don't know what the upside is

2:00:22

so that's it's not a huge missed opportunity because it's not like i had invested in a previous year was just i shoulda should have put a chip down there and

2:00:29

that's what i mean we don't want to fall victim to confirmation bias here though right because this is what i mean ostk is walking the line of a missed

2:00:35

opportunity and that's why they want to put lxu down because then you start there's companies that i did pass on

2:00:42

at the time that did not go up significantly you know what i mean so you got to be careful documenting this stuff um

2:00:50

but i know this i know this and so um but i remember what was going through my

2:00:55

mind at the time but i don't okay that's fine

2:01:00

all right we'll keep it in there and we'll keep it in there torn

2:01:11

okay oh hov so just crushing it i mean that's just that's going to be a big winner i got i had quite a bit of exposure outside of

2:01:17

the roaring kitty portfolio too so that's just going to work out really well and the thing about that was i kept on adding because i bought quite a bit of

2:01:24

the higher quality homebuilders because i didn't know what's going on and i kept on adding right here that was a really good decision um

2:01:33

like it was all over the place but i'm like home builders they're looking good i think i may have even bought here too

2:01:39

and it turned out to be a really good decision and it's a triple i mean it's a triple from even those those later purchases

2:01:45

but i saw my average and one of those accounts was like eight bucks or nine bucks or

2:01:51

something so that was sick now it's kind of getting away who knows

2:01:59

all right lifeway foods they do yeah i remember that that's not my cup of tea kirklands ah

2:02:08

i say that oh no

2:02:16

what look at this every week it's a clear candlestick

2:02:22

uh who was talking about kirklands

2:02:28

oh no i thought they were did i think they were toast

2:02:33

and then when it sold off and no that was march then it leveled off

2:02:38

wow damn

2:02:44

i can't believe i gotta list this i feel like i did pull the trigger on

2:02:49

some of these and when it i feel like i just pulled the trigger on the wrong one of these damn that's right they're super speckled

2:02:55

super risky super risky you got to put the chips down on a couple of these ones this would have been one of them this would have been one of those yeah i

2:03:00

could go bankrupt but if it doesn't i didn't i don't i don't think i would have forecasted a quick recovery to nine

2:03:05

bucks like that because it looked real it was looked really these discount so that's the thing um

2:03:15

let's just double check what they do exactly um it's the specialty retailer but um

2:03:21

various merchandise yes it's home stuff right is it discount stuff

2:03:31

i thought they were going to have trouble because there's a couple of there's a number of companies out there like that there's one that's in bankruptcy tuesday q

2:03:37

that's already doubled off the low one's in bankruptcy

2:03:45

but some of these are doing okay just given the environment these discount retailers are holding up okay

2:03:51

but uh then then you have ones that they might bounce because of um the interest i mean people buying new homes and stuff like that like if that's

2:03:57

what they're doing and people are buying specialty of course still i um

2:04:03

you wouldn't think that they're going to be hugely profitable interesting and then there's some other i mean there's some common ones out there bassett

2:04:09

that's a safer play there's a safer way to play it they had a stronger balance sheet as i recall

2:04:15

i have a pretty low cost basis than this but it's only a double but it's a pretty strong balance sheet but yeah maybe these would do well that was

2:04:20

that was my thinking i was like ah how would some other way to play this residential real estate and these were some of the ones that i bought but i

2:04:26

didn't do kirklands i thought they might be in trouble that's okay no biggie okay let's keep

2:04:34

going rfp so look at this so we probably

2:04:39

should so look at look at all look at how many are in the portfolio whoa one two three four five six

2:04:47

six out of about 40 of them that's not bad that's a good percentage

2:04:53

they're good size positions too the only one that's small is cyh everything else is over 50 is over a

2:04:59

half a percent that's legit that's a good day um look at this gbtc i had to add that

2:05:04

to the sick wow that's going to be that's going to be fortunate not a huge position right

2:05:10

it's more for the story right sometimes you just got to do it for the story look at barrack gold up 12 today on the buffett bumps

2:05:20

cvgi hey tuesday q was up 13 today wow all right do i see anything

2:05:28

any non positions oh kirklands that sucks um and serve no these are a lot of

2:05:33

biotechs i mean i'm not opposed to um i'm not opposed i don't typically deal in biotech but if i really need to

2:05:39

see something that catches my attention like if i were maybe we'll get to the point where we have some time or there's a couple of

2:05:44

those but i think i found a new biotech fund by the way um um

2:05:50

where maybe if they have a heavy position that would take so i don't just i'm just gonna i'm just gonna buy just because another

2:05:57

prominent biotech fund has an allocation that's not enough for me but if they're buying or i see insider buying or if i

2:06:02

actually pour if i if i analyze the the drugs that they have relative to another company out there maybe but i

2:06:10

like right now i'm just totally skipping over these dark green ones i can't i can't go down that path right now i'd really need to see something

2:06:17

outside of here that got my attention there's just too many of them this there's too many wow barracks a big

2:06:23

company too is that the biggest market cap mover today look at this 53 billion oh look at tesla talk about barrett gold

2:06:31

53 53 billion how about tesla 340 billion what a huge move how many how many

2:06:36

billion did it add today is that 30 billion 40 billion wow just great just funny money you know

2:06:45

yeah by far the biggest movers no i mean will tesla was wow good not a bad day huh reads

2:06:53

i've looked at i've never owned this one soft drinks yeah it's a triple were they buying

2:07:00

this i definitely want to classify as a missed opportunity but i've passed on it i've passed on it a number of times i

2:07:06

did i didn't like what i saw oh well that's some serious insider buying

2:07:11

interim ceo dropped a million on it but then not much since

2:07:20

all right i'll pull it up

2:07:26

lumber liquidators that's a tough one i remember when there was a big short short article posted about that years ago turned out to be right

2:07:36

gpl that's a silver company speculative silver company

2:07:43

oh you know what this would have been a time to maybe deal on some of those is it

2:07:50

oh you know what maybe there's a couple of these silver there's a couple of these silver miners i have that i track that they're um

2:07:57

developmental like let me pop this open oh boy maybe i should be adding some of these you know what i mean like super speculative but

2:08:04

if silver takes off you know what i mean that was not i mean more speculative than new gold

2:08:09

like like they don't even have i don't even know if they're producing any silver i forget they might be there's there's

2:08:16

like three or four of them that i'm tracking in here somewhere interesting oh let's do this let's do this watch

2:08:22

this okay so here's gpl that's the business

2:08:28

which is also here right here nice operates precious metals the next exposure for silver gold yeah yeah okay

2:08:34

but can i click this this brings me to the silver chart so let's pop this up real quick huh so this is silver so this is i should be doing more of this right but

2:08:41

i'm just trying to get my bearings you know what i mean but this is an important part of like screening through stuff so you come across a company or an

2:08:46

industry that looks compelling that's the thing it really should be um a really narrow focus for this for you to get the

2:08:52

most use out of this but silver is a good use so let's see silver this is the general materials sector here first

2:08:57

then you have metals and mining um look at this good trend right as we recall materials is doing well then you have

2:09:03

okay this is a silver etf crushing it

2:09:08

okay now this is silver itself um so that's sick and now you got gold i

2:09:14

thought you know what you probably also if you're looking at silver you probably also want to see what the gold price is doing all right now we got palladium same

2:09:19

thing i want to include palladium in there okay platinum i thought i'd include all the metals these are all

2:09:26

deliberate choices to include them there was platinum dome patton's up 50 off those lows nice okay

2:09:33

so here we go here's wheaton um pretty much new highs

2:09:40

are you gonna expect this right silver wait you know what though let me the market cap was 22 huge huge one let me just do this i want

2:09:47

to see the longer term one

2:09:52

it's at all is that all-time highs how about 2008 all-time highs okay meaningful so let's keep going

2:10:02

panamerica this was a this was a preferred silver play back in the day i didn't buy it this time

2:10:08

probably a mistake because this would have been a safer way to play silver back in march and april but six billion

2:10:14

it was i've always viewed it as like a little bit too big for me

2:10:21

that's why i went with cde is that it's right there it's up it's

2:10:26

right there look at that that's right there too okay but right there on the i'm like kind of

2:10:33

breaking out there you know um okay there's not that many silver miners so there's only two pages here

2:10:39

so that's why i'm pulling each one up this is a big one ag

2:10:48

i kind of keep on it okay all right so here we get maybe

2:10:55

we'll get to some of these more speculative ones heckler yep so here's one of them no that's not aspect it was still one billion dollars it's not that

2:11:09

hmm wow that was a great opportunity last

2:11:14

year six bucks six bucks i've always felt that that was kind of rich for heckler but if silver comes in favor in a big way

2:11:20

and i'm not predicting that per se i'm just like i'm just trying to be prepared for it mentally you know if it like you got like a blow off top

2:11:26

okay mag i don't really know mag cde yup

2:11:32

that went up to 6 did i go up to 16 last time

2:11:40

yeah i mean that looks like a little bit of a squeeze doesn't it taking out those uh wow it got up to

2:11:46

eight bucks last year oh man i own it but uh

2:11:51

not enough i should have bought more that's like my that's like my go-to silver plate too what's the market cap that i had on this

2:11:57

1 billion damn okay silver crest now we're starting to get into them

2:12:04

oh that looks good whoa does it produce that looks really good

2:12:11

whoa pull it up oh i can't

2:12:20

this my ad hoc one yeah

2:12:25

oh i forgot i put those in for uh was it tigger

2:12:37

for tuna that's one of them endeavor that's one of them and gpl okay

2:12:43

those are the three ex gpl and fortuna okay fsm

2:12:49

let's check it out

2:12:55

all right so all looking kind of similar exk i've i've invested in the xk in the

2:13:02

past quick quick triple

2:13:09

all right can we do some uh some artistic stuff here oh yeah i forgot to change that to red

2:13:16

sure oh that was why i didn't do red because they had the red thing on there

2:13:23

this was when we were in a little bit okay this could have some legs huh exk

2:13:30

i mean they call that analysis right i'm looking at looking at a chart saying hey this could keep going up i'm just saying and like

2:13:35

like a speculative blow-off you know some people say that we already we already have that right here right now it already happened and then um

2:13:44

all right so then no it's different okay

2:13:52

i thought this one there's some let me just check this

2:14:02

like i don't think this even has any oh it's ground there you go 150.

2:14:08

it was like look how small it was you know book value of is that the price a dollar it's not right is it

2:14:16

oh it is interesting oh this might be a way to

2:14:23

play it is it what do you think oh and it's overbought real of course it's overbought right now what about gpl and

2:14:29

uh gpl this looks interesting

2:14:38

gpl

2:14:47

more so gpl i'd say i mean what am i doing i don't even to be honest i don't i'm just kind of looking at the chart some of them are already breaking out to

2:14:52

new all-time highs some of them are close to where their highs of 2011 were that um

2:15:01

what i really need to do is come on like i see it's just this is gonna sound

2:15:08

silly because we all know the price of the stock it doesn't matter isn't all that meaningful right but like some people might see a dollar

2:15:13

silver stock and then it just gets bit up you know what i mean and that by the same token like if you do uh some of the bigger silver miners people just

2:15:20

buy it because they know the name and they just want exposure to it especially like take barrick gold for example the ticker's gold people know barrett gold

2:15:26

now buffett bought it up what we say up 10 today but like this one it's only a dollar stock price and uh

2:15:33

but it's speculative but who knows

2:15:38

i might just i might buy this i know that's crazy bad analysis you might think that's bad analysis but i don't know stop

2:15:44

this let me pull up those i know i'm jumping all over the place i apologize for that

2:15:55

and then i have silver here number three

2:16:01

s-i-l-v sorry yeah i uh maybe i don't have like i've

2:16:07

forgotten that i had i was tracking these small or super speculative companies that i never owned i'm like i don't know what the hell these are gonna

2:16:13

do and in the back of my mind i kept them i kept them in this look at this silver crest has zero

2:16:18

revenues you know what i mean zero revenues and you know what that i mean

2:16:23

value traditional values may see this and they think what i don't know what to do with this company i don't i don't want to value this company i don't know anything about it

2:16:29

what you got to try to pick apart the reserves and do your best to value that i see this and you know what i think i think no one else knows what the value

2:16:36

is and therefore the value could be infinity uh that sounds crazy you know what i mean but

2:16:41

i mean you see with some of the stuff some of the stuff what some of the prices are doing on some of these really high risk speculative companies you can

2:16:47

see what they do and it's when you don't know what those free cash flows are that people's minds just is book value a dollar oh

2:16:53

this is the one that's priced at nine bucks it's a 1.6 billion market cap look at

2:16:59

this see what i mean it's already 1.6 billion i don't even know if that's how oh that's

2:17:05

here i am calling it a speculative company it's bigger than it's bigger than cd isn't it

2:17:12

oh no not quite but let me just see what what's yahoo say the revenues are my number my numbers right ttm zero zero in

2:17:19

revenues here you go

2:17:26

wow wow

2:17:35

okay so now when we pull i got gpl fsm and exk

2:17:46

um let me do by that silv no revenues huh all right let me just do exk

2:17:52

and let me do fsa oh hate when i do that

2:17:59

let me do exk and fsm because i don't think i added

2:18:05

that to the other one uh all over the place i should have done this more cleanly

2:18:12

am i really gonna buy one of these i don't know what i'm doing i just silver is getting uh i don't

2:18:18

wanna get roped into it you know what i mean you gotta be careful of that but it's looking pretty damn bullish

2:18:24

and then um we looked at hp i think right i showed you those good numbers i think i did i

2:18:30

hope i did i forget all right let me just pop back to this

2:18:35

one to see gpl all right we got gpl open so this one's yeah looking uh it's at a

2:18:41

buck four times 10 to a book market cap 353 i like that that's good i

2:18:46

mean i have nothing to do with this i can't do anything with these numbers this is straight this is straight narrative this is

2:18:53

straight um well some people might say oh it's

2:18:59

bubblicious don't get caught in it you know like these outstanding shares been issuing shares been financing this

2:19:05

big jump up in revenue so they finally started to produce or it's been a slow ramp up i should say

2:19:10

but um it's not like cheap such it's not cheap based on any metrics but um

2:19:16

oh net cash flow it's got some positive net cash flow there but it's so small

2:19:21

hmm yeah there's nothing in here for that and what about um fsm is for a three and four

2:19:31

so this one's a more legitimate business i've invested in them before boy they still hung around i was always

2:19:37

wondering if they were going to make it positive operating cash flow all across the board check this

2:19:44

except for trailing 12 months right important um it's still super speculative there's nothing i can do with this i can't do anything that's

2:19:50

just um i can look at the balance sheet and it's classified as safe that sticks out to me safe and a big

2:19:58

part of that is because these um that common overhang right here you know what i need is highlighted that highlights rows too

2:20:04

and that coming off i think zero so no debt or uh or it's covered by its cash but i

2:20:10

see book value of a buck it trades at four times book value right now right but the thinking is

2:20:16

that it has tremendous operating leverage that all these have tremendous operating leverage that once they start um trying to generate a profit it will

2:20:23

be substantial relative to its book value and then let me just check fsm

2:20:40

now i'm going to say consider adding to silver but this is really just a precious metals angle like i said i felt like i was a little bit underexposed and

2:20:46

you got to be careful you don't want to chase too much you definitely want to wait for pull backs but at the same time like you saw me i

2:20:52

pulled the trigger on gbtc i have no idea what that's but i just see the stuff and how it's kind of unfolding and i think

2:20:57

damn something like this could go quite a bit higher it may not be over yet it could be it could be and that's cool

2:21:03

that's why this these would never be big positions but anyway like silver and gold and palladium these ones are kind of getting

2:21:08

i'm not sure it's over yet like i said i mean gold breaking out to new all-time highs and silver's not i mean

2:21:14

silver's not even not even there yet is it even did it break did it break those

2:21:20

it didn't even break the i mean yeah i remember 50 bucks right did it hit 50

2:21:26

49 oh it's right there didn't get there i remember that um

2:21:32

that doesn't i mean what does that mean it's not like it has to make altar or anything like that i'm just saying you're seeing other stuff hit all-time

2:21:38

highs and other people going to look at this and then you know i don't know what's that cost of production on silver i can't say i know that right off the

2:21:45

top of my head look watch what i'm gonna do

2:21:56

what you would do is a good way to go about this is to pull up the um

2:22:01

oh here we go is to pull up just the reports of the top of the biggest miners whatever the biggest miners are saying they're

2:22:07

roughly they're going to say all-in costs and cash flow costs and you're just looking for a ballpark figure you don't worry about the precise cost

2:22:13

or anything like that like what is it this is s p global silver all in sustaining cost to fall again so would they say it was this is

2:22:19

this is going to be this is going to be good enough for me um wait what year was this 2019. this is

2:22:25

good enough for me what do you got

2:22:33

eleven dollars an ounce you're kidding me

2:22:44

what is this silver is it 10 12 bucks is that what you this is non-primary

2:22:49

all-ins wow see what i mean how you gonna get to uh 50 bucks on that a speculation really

2:22:57

and people getting ahead of itself i mean that's an inflation play right because you expect the cost of production to rise but that rapidly that

2:23:03

quick i don't think so um that's what i mean that's why it's

2:23:08

easier for me to buy these things on the pullback when you have not that silver was ever wait where has silver been trading

2:23:15

so look at this so it's easier it's easy to make the case right well first of all technically it's at support look at that oh look at

2:23:21

this support these commodities i i swear they these come on like they're more special like commodities and like

2:23:28

bitcoin and something like tesla although i forget off the top of my head but like these things like trade kind of to the chart

2:23:34

um it's kind of funny i think maybe the people who are often dealing with them are like technical analyst type folks because like how else are you gonna go

2:23:40

about there's no cash flows related to silver you know what i mean so it's like they have to go up look at this all the way back look at

2:23:45

this it goes all the way back like this oh what a riot this is anyway if the cost of production is 10

2:23:52

12 bucks and you're trading at cost of production it's used to be like all right well what if the price the price could the price get up and then here it did double

2:23:57

but even easier if it's trading at like eight bucks per share you know i'm not per share you know what i mean um because then it's like all right well

2:24:03

i know it's going to hover around the cost of production so long as the cost of production doesn't decline in a deflationary environment

2:24:08

you'd be okay but now when you're buying it 30 bucks an ounce it starts to get

2:24:14

precarious you know what i mean i'm i could never have and this play is um

2:24:23

i'm less confident in this type of bullishness around silver than i am about bitcoin and what i can't believe that i'm even

2:24:28

bringing up the word confident when i'm talking about bitcoin because i'm not don't get the wrong idea

2:24:35

but um okay

2:24:41

i mean 15 bucks max unless you expect really crazy inflation what some people are and then a shortage

2:24:47

of silver i mean supplies and uh um a silver if shovels in short supply

2:24:52

because there could be increased demand too because isn't there a lot of silver used and like renewable type stuff and

2:24:59

like solar panels and stuff and and it's used for a whole number of things so there could be like a secular bull market and gold that's

2:25:05

part of the case in palladium too for those um for the catalytic converters the auto

2:25:11

market but then also i think it's used in more some renewable type stuff i kind of forget off the top of my head but i remember looking into it at the time

2:25:16

being like holy there might be a a supply deficit and then then uh cost of production be damned because people

2:25:22

will pay whatever they people pay whatever they want just to get their hands on it you know what i mean they don't give a they're like uh

2:25:27

i don't care that there's that were well above what it costs you to produce there's just not that much out there so i need it and then the price goes boom

2:25:33

boom boom boom boom and the stock prices adjust accordingly

2:25:38

so i don't know i can kind of see this maybe maybe that i list them consider writing so so anyway

2:25:44

i say consider silver it's more just to play on like this gold precious metals and gold silver palladium and i have decent

2:25:51

explode when you include spsw2 what would we say was five percent that's if you include that so i don't

2:25:57

know let's list the exk i'd say exk i mean still wellable of

2:26:02

those highs i just people are other people gonna see that if i think i don't know

2:26:08

and then what was the other one fsm

2:26:14

i mean then you got um then you got a lot of ups upside on this one do i have the fundamentals for fsm

2:26:24

oh here it is oh it's not bad for four bucks in book

2:26:29

value on a seven dollar share price wow this doesn't just look like an issue and

2:26:35

shares along the way i'm sure right yeah issue and shares that helps equity growth right you're student shares if they're happening above book value

2:26:42

and it's profitable oh this one's not bad this was through 2019 by the way canadian company so we'll look up inside

2:26:48

of buying here all right maybe fsm yxk you have a seven what was that dollar one i think i'd toss that one in

2:26:54

there too gpl i think i might i think i might dabble in these

2:27:02

i might dabble on these look at this i don't know

2:27:12

i hate i hate doing an uptrend too it's almost like i want to wait for him to pull back maybe i'll do a little bit i don't know what do i just say

2:27:18

consider adding to silver via because i already have silver cd and then the gold miners produce

2:27:24

silver as well but okay sorry that was quite a bit of a tangent but these types of things

2:27:29

when they come up it's like you gotta consider like i said i don't see too many trendier things right now potentially

2:27:35

value generally you know what i mean emerging markets and commodities and but even that's not definite yet

2:27:42

but then silver precious metals all right okay that's all i'm just gonna talk about that oh in the inside of buying just real

2:27:48

quick sorry remember the insider buying on barrack oh they crushed it huh that was sick

2:27:56

oh i might even have here we go i got endeavour silver in here you see this i already got it in there do i have them all kestrel go oh i actually don't know

2:28:04

oh kgc oh i thought that was ken ross oh there's ken ross okay oh that was another way i forgot about kenmore ken

2:28:10

ross wow oh it's kgc in america

2:28:16

oh that's a way to play it too that's a that's a oh that looks good huh that's a bigger play oh

2:28:25

i looked at it here looked at it here i never got that never got that cheap this this time

2:28:30

oh kendras might be away

2:28:37

this isn't like an immediate pull the trigger it's just like now i i did the iag at iag would i say no what was the

2:28:42

other one i said no gold

2:28:48

oh a u oh i forgot about eu oh that was one of my favorite ones it's just because i was such a big winner for

2:28:55

me the big winners become my favorite ones uh i'm not going to add to you kg kgc though maybe

2:29:03

that's a big one though

2:29:09

12 billion that's i'm just i'm just listing stuff

2:29:15

i'm just listing oh there's another one avino silver oh that was another one that i was thinking about

2:29:20

but it's not on my list why isn't it on my list oh okay

2:29:30

was that not on my list that's weird i might have taken it off some of these i might have taken i've been tracking them for years and i'm

2:29:35

like just forget about it of course that march was the time to be

2:29:41

doing that damn i missed i'm like let's drop the ball

2:29:46

interesting okay um x out of these oh i meant to take a peek

2:29:52

at reid i'll do that after i'm good side to

2:29:57

bottom i can read uh let me close out of some of these and let's just keep looking at the all right let me pull up

2:30:03

oh i got four two i got four tuning in here too circ see what i mean i was just tracking them

2:30:08

i'm missing i got i get gpl too great panther there's so i'm missing one grape gp i was there one of those

2:30:14

missing no i got them all right i got them all exact i got them all okay

2:30:20

let's go boom keshel gold i don't even know what that is i don't know if that trades in the u.s

2:30:27

silver corp i forgot about that one aveeno

2:30:33

i'll take a peek at yamana for tuna gpl

2:30:38

oh v in that that was one that i looked at i am gold all right i'll take a peek at that

2:30:43

i mean what the this the insider buying matters less on these right because it's this isn't it's not it's a different type of play

2:30:50

than the usual value plays right i just just trying to take a peek that's all

2:30:55

remember like seeing back goal by right at that low that was just crash okay so nothing for exk i don't even i'm

2:31:01

not i don't know kestrel gold oh look at these timely part two two

2:31:08

cents wait a second oh i got two cents i haven't got time for that that's not

2:31:14

it could be something that that's that will not be a lost opportunity disposition in august

2:31:19

180. whoa no behind okay aveeno

2:31:26

avino

2:31:32

nothing yamada yeah whatever

2:31:38

nada oh there was something there when was that i think we saw this march

2:31:45

nice job wow look at that peterborough oh i looked at him he is um

2:31:52

this is part of why i liked it i think he's a higher up he might be the ceo or something

2:31:59

he's bought before executive chairman boom and he was

2:32:05

buying nice job march 30th

2:32:13

nothing no big deal but i just especially for these speculative ones if they started buying i'd be like whoa

2:32:19

okay here we go kind of add to the theory they're all disposing not much happening they might not even

2:32:26

be able to right now maybe i don't know if they've reported oh i'm slow streaming i'm slow streaming

2:32:33

i got probably because i opened up all those web pages huh that that should stop that'll go away all right i think that's good enough

2:32:40

that's enough silver i don't even get there

2:32:46

oh gpl look at that see what i mean and then i get to track done something like that but that's why it's important to look

2:32:51

all right let's just take a peek at what was down 9 30 oh look at this 67 percent uh this

2:32:57

is these are funny to look at these charts huh holy hell oh would you say this chart is bullish

2:33:03

or bearish oh god oh

2:33:09

oh i see how he gets bit up right before too well people trying to play ouch people trying to play the phase

2:33:18

results damn that's rough yikes don't know it

2:33:23

pac-d oh yeah remember this one offshore driller they used to have high quality they're gonna

2:33:29

i wrote them off i wrote off all the offshore drillers i don't think i owned any coming out of march

2:33:36

did valares go bankrupt yet i can't this one remember ensco esv

2:33:43

wow look think back five years it's kind of hard to believe it was hard

2:33:49

to believe five like esp was a big position for me 2015 2016 and a big one but those offshore drillers were never

2:33:54

that big of a winner for me which was a little bit of a red flag i remember thinking that um like watch this

2:34:04

so this was this was n skull wasn't it it was this is that all it got down to well this is so many reverse splits

2:34:10

right oh really wow esv was like a high quality

2:34:16

offshore driller and they uh they had diamond offshore which had the older rigs and you had uh and then pac-d always had

2:34:23

a younger fleet but it was like uh with a they were like a foreign company so was

2:34:29

it's tough to get super confident with those and uh yeah i wrote them all off and is diamond

2:34:34

did the diamond finally go bankrupt dio did they all go bankrupt oh this is

2:34:41

terrible the me of five years ago was like what but them never being that strong of a

2:34:47

bouncer coming out of those fifty twenty fifteen twenty six animals i was always like what the hell because i remember i had oil sands i had the

2:34:53

offshore drillers and they were winners but they weren't like the biggest winners and i'm always thinking like they should have been bigger winners

2:34:59

i don't know what the hell do i know look at this huh wow

2:35:07

all right party yeah that's no big deal that was up ipi all right so i don't even know what was it was it a ten for one okay good so the

2:35:14

chart's already reflecting this yeah i'm not doing with this unless they start buying i don't buy it

2:35:20

i mean i got in the portfolio but it's just small i've been disappointed and now they got they're getting hit

2:35:26

with the uh energy with their energy because their increased exposure to energy by way of the water rates i'm not doing anything

2:35:33

with it i'm not even digging into it all right okay and then just quick we

2:35:40

already did the insider buying but um we've covered a lot of this stuff already but if i just pop this up ufi we looked into oln oh

2:35:46

oln did we a million as a million in the past week look at this insider

2:35:52

bond when did we look when did we look together today's the 17th 16th oh so we must have looked on friday then

2:35:57

yeah this is looking good did i just pull i pulled up the um

2:36:02

i pulled it up where'd i pull it up

2:36:07

thought i pulled it up wait there it is

2:36:18

there we go um so leveraged

2:36:23

it's leveraged but solid revenue huh five six billion dollars that's no joke big big sell-off this year though right but

2:36:28

shouldn't be too surprising you'd expect chemicals to underperform these past three months six months maybe

2:36:33

even year but historical historically solid operating cash flow you know look at this five bucks versus a share

2:36:42

price of 10 operating cash flow not free cash flow not free cash flow but then even simpler free cash flow you almost had three bucks

2:36:49

last year trolling 12 months on a 10 share price they have a long history of paying dividends now where is it 80 cent look at this

2:36:57

right there 80 cents 80 cents 80 cents 80 cents 80 cents

2:37:02

wow huh to not even change it what the hell that's kind of crazy

2:37:10

that's kind of unusual isn't it for it to not to increase or decrease do you ever see that i don't know if i've ever seen that

2:37:20

in the earnings earnings been decent volatile times but nothing crazy

2:37:25

but that leverage so it's the leverage that's a concern here clearly a big risk but a history of free cash flow

2:37:33

over this cycle anyway but even last cycle earning about a buck it's good it's down years and right now

2:37:40

we're clearly going into the down years that's where people are forecasting here you see what i mean like um this is simple free cash flow right here

2:37:48

and you'll have some good years green then a red year and then green year and then two non-green yeah just to talk about conditional forming not even get

2:37:54

into the numbers you know what i mean and then bounces back some strong green years in the stock price if we looked at it i'm

2:37:59

sure it was thriving from 2013 to 2019. now this could be the start of a multi-year struggle this is why the

2:38:05

stock price is coming down in some ways justifiably so you know what i mean but um

2:38:14

but historically deep not not bad and how about some how about some metrics here i don't

2:38:20

how about gross margin 20 so on the boom years you're at 20 low 20s and then okay look at gross margins so

2:38:27

you know i don't like this look at this it's struggling here these are these are 20-year lows we're at right now

2:38:34

seven percent gross margin uh they're gonna get their cut they're gonna get their costs in order cost management oh that's a real

2:38:40

that's a big drop that's one of the biggest red flags i'm seeing from 15 so volatile 15

2:38:48

gross margin just seven percent gross margin wow big drop and then the leverage of course

2:38:54

too but so the dividend cut the dividend what are you doing cut the dividend they must have uh they're being priced to cut the dividend

2:39:00

clearly right 80 cents on a 10 share price they're gonna cut the dividend did they not do it yet but do they have a long history and that's why

2:39:06

they don't want to do it dumb wait till carl sees this wait till carl icon sees this you think you're

2:39:11

going to keep paying that dividend i don't think so oh yeah this guy's get some good ideas

2:39:16

on um on these chemical companies i've read him i hadn't read them before this but

2:39:22

uh he seemed logical oh he's been talking about him for a while actually

2:39:28

2019 oh he's been bullish for a while ouch oh i didn't know he's been bullish that

2:39:34

long huh for a year oh that hasn't worked out but he's still i read his research it wasn't bad it was like covering a lot of

2:39:39

the basics of the analysis especially on tsc tsc thesis seems really simple to me um they pay a dividend too

2:39:47

but t ts thesis seems really straightforward to me like i think it's like a clean double even from here

2:39:53

um but it was training like 15 20 bucks that was stupid cheap

2:39:58

um but olen a little bit more leveraged although tse was leveraged but they they were at one point they weren't like eight

2:40:03

bucks per share and they were trading like 14 dollars like stupid like the olin's not that cheap

2:40:09

um hmm but then okay let's pull up

2:40:16

i might be i'm looking at this because i might be willing to go heavier until oil and right off the bat i i bought um i already owned it but i

2:40:22

had trimmed quite a bit coming out of the march lows and then we saw look at these bonds

2:40:27

nice boy i mean you see the i'm invested in i don't see concentrating

2:40:33

that part of that off i see i see a rating on bb minus i'm like yes yes yes yes yes

2:40:39

that i'm even looking at a company with those bonds it's like is there really opportunity there but it could be a limited downside opportunity you know

2:40:44

what i mean but i don't know what the with the leverage here yikes

2:40:55

and his charges charts looking interesting though it's not super bullish but look at this

2:41:01

oh is this 10 was it down five percent today okay i don't remember what i bought

2:41:06

if i just if i just added i added recently an eleven dollar range not much it never got up that much wow i missed

2:41:12

this look at that it's because it's a oh if this breaks down below 10 look out huh

2:41:20

this is a good buying option this is a good buy price though you know what i mean look at this look at this chart too

2:41:32

this chart looks like there's no denying it

2:41:39

ah i think i'd read his and i'm not going to read it now but i'd read his does he have updated analysis march 13th i probably already read that

2:41:45

does he get some comments sometimes i'll just look at their comments the facts poster and say oh second quarter suggests buying the pullback

2:41:51

yeah he's been super bullish on it it seems i mean i don't mean to knock him he seemed overly bullish in ways but

2:41:57

when you read sometimes you just read their analysis and they're clearly clear thinking people i may disagree with their conclusions on

2:42:03

stuff and uh but um but it seems a little bit aggressively

2:42:09

bullish and i know it's not where i'm not saying that just because it seems like it's some of it's worked out against them but it seemed like logical thinking

2:42:16

real data showing big excel oh this is a different company did you talk about um

2:42:24

three dominant players that's right that's more about trenseo yeah i just wanted to see if he said

2:42:29

anything oh his first comment there was from uh tse and olin should be up on the back

2:42:35

of the increasing guidance oh i don't know covestro so is that a rail company glad you are in on dow

2:42:40

dao has been awesome i'm just trying to check it's just a quick policy if you said anything recently about them

2:42:46

i'm not seeing too much okay no worries i can check his analysis again later probably the same thesis holds that i read earlier that's all but

2:42:53

i like i do like i do like these what's the market cap sorry 1.7

2:43:02

it's not bad i kind of need something to be happy that insider buying is good that's right they got the insider buying

2:43:07

i want something like to be happening you know what i mean something that to get them out of this rut like someone get involved or someone's saying we're

2:43:12

going to cut the dividend like do something um do they i mean maybe they already cut the dividend

2:43:18

if they cut the dividend we would have seen a huge sell-off

2:43:24

i just want to check sometimes i'll just check like the last 10 news releases that they have there you go

2:43:30

i'm going to command f dividend right here this is uh oh new leadership okay that's something announced after an

2:43:36

extensive search which commenced the borders has selected scott sutton to succeed as presidency okay new ceo okay

2:43:42

it's just got just getting started though mr fisher will become executive ceo and chairman to succeed oh

2:43:49

he's going to be the chairman these chairmans are effective okay new ceo that's all i'm just getting the feel for

2:43:54

and then uh this net loss um chairman president said

2:44:02

second quarter for the declined your view by 27 wow sales guy reflects weaker customer yep um

2:44:09

compared to the first quarter can you see that okay yeah the epoxy business outlook chlor alkali business and vinyls

2:44:16

they have like a strong foothold in this industry i forget if the lar i think they might be the largest actually

2:44:21

visibility around future demand continues to be limited of course during 20 civil industrial refinancing

2:44:26

of a portion of the high cost bonds assumed during the 2015 yep okay refinancing winding down the

2:44:32

multi-year information technology okay so that some of this stuff sounds like it's going to take time so people getting out you know what i

2:44:37

mean like i'll come back in later final chloride multi-year in addition to

2:44:42

the tony olin expects to benefit in 2020 from lower maintenance turnaround

2:44:48

segment reporting blah blah blah cash liquidated in the second quarter 2020 amended our 1.3 billion secured credit

2:44:54

this is one i'd like to check out their investor relations presentation too okay when did they do this during our

2:44:59

second quarter oh they issued debt during the second quarter issued 500 million of nine and a

2:45:05

half senior notes due 2025 all right that's actually a better interest rate than gamestop and a longer term time horizon you know just

2:45:12

i mean it should be but damn nine and a half percent uh for a company with a pretty good

2:45:18

history that kind of sucks has no mandatory debt repayments until august 2020 i like to see that

2:45:25

cash balance declare the dividend of 20 cents the dividend is planned this will be the congratulations this

2:45:31

will be the 375th consecutive quarterly congratulations we just predicted this

2:45:37

you know they're gonna you know they're gonna talk it up because they're like proud of this dividend they're just like who cares no

2:45:42

one cares some people care i guess it it's like the management's reputation if you founded the business maybe is the

2:45:49

olin family like is that the family name and they're still otherwise who cares

2:45:55

um i mean it's nice if you're crushing it but your business isn't crushing it right now so it could make sense to cut

2:46:00

the divot and that could be the right decision to make me because maybe the optics aren't the bit dumb whatever

2:46:08

but this is what i mean so this could sell off more i like the insider buying this is good but i could see this

2:46:15

selling off some more and this could get even more attractive you know what i mean imagine if it takes out these imagine if it takes out

2:46:20

eight i don't know if we could take out the eight but when you don't have much book value you don't have you don't have much book value to hold to support it

2:46:25

you have negative tangible book value how much the total debt that they have

2:46:31

4.4 billion oh this could sell off this could sell off right and then

2:46:36

they'll be in like a tough spot and then they cut the dividends like oh you got to be proactive about some of the stuff so this is something to watch

2:46:43

um they got cash flow though you know what i mean it's cheap it's not super cheap and it

2:46:50

could get cheaper it's like do i feel comfortable with my position right now how much do 945 oh

2:46:56

point seven percent i feel kind of okay with that

2:47:01

right now i feel kind of okay with that i just

2:47:08

added to it that's why i'm glad i added to it but i don't know if it's a percentage

2:47:13

just yet plus the upsides not like i don't see tremendous upside i mean i see what it historically traded

2:47:20

at but we look at the fundamentals how would he oh it didn't oh but uh what about if we adjust for the dividend

2:47:27

35 yeah that's what i mean it's it's it's peak price it's 30 bucks and i i mean i i

2:47:34

know i'm just looking at the chart there but um it's hard for me to get to where you get into 30 bucks i uh

2:47:39

even book value had been growing at that pace even at two times book value that's like

2:47:44

a high so i just i don't see the tremendous upside yet you know so that the the discount rate that you use

2:47:50

that's what you want to earn and i uh so it's like it looks interesting but i'm trying to earn higher rates of

2:47:55

return so maybe i'll just wait for a little bit of a sell-off before i go heavier i don't want to be on be on my

2:48:01

heels okay so that was daily so okay so that kind of took a while we got to be quicker about that i think but um

2:48:08

by the same time i'm looking into companies dig it in okay so 945 can we um

2:48:15

if i go back to the portfolio

2:48:21

and what if i uh get back to those charts it'd be nice to finish up those charts if you don't mind i think you remember what i was on was i am like

2:48:28

i don't remember what i was on was i on page five page three

2:48:39

oh i don't remember okay cvgi crushing it cd crushing it ufi

2:48:48

we added and we talked about adding even some more we've we've dug deep deep into this so that's good

2:48:53

uh mac looks interesting that's why i said look into mac

2:48:59

okay they haven't bought since march that's kind of sucks because the insider buying was something that really caught my attention

2:49:09

mac 2 i don't know robert persins i don't know his analysis daniel threat bearish but further

2:49:15

dividend cuts are very loud they still got their dividend i don't know their analysis too much passive investment

2:49:21

oh i don't know who passive investment trust is it doesn't mean anything to me oh but let's look it up

2:49:27

let's look up let's see who uh this is one thing i could be doing as i go through these charts you know

2:49:33

looking at who about what ontario teachers no no passive investment trust i don't know you but let me look at your holdings

2:49:39

okay so no one dabbled oh

2:49:46

wow what a weird name huh could you get more vague than that passive investment trust the hell you can't even find

2:49:54

the website you know what i mean maybe that was on purpose

2:50:02

but this looks interesting i um i'm gonna write it again i know i did

2:50:11

this looks like an ad right if i i'm either wrong or i'm right really really insightful comments i

2:50:18

might i'm either wrong or i'm right you know what i mean you feel me but uh either way whether i'm right or

2:50:24

wrong it's like now is a good time to be doing something you know what i mean because it's kind of flat lining like

2:50:29

a lot's happened over the past we see these other charts right um and a lot's happened over the past two months some

2:50:36

a lot of things are up but it's kind of flat-lined and you might say all right well that's kind of that doesn't bode well because if things do come down

2:50:41

it'll come down too that's a fair point i don't have much of an encounter argument to that except i could just set a stop loss

2:50:46

and if everything does come down but otherwise maybe it's just taking them some time to get their together you know what i mean

2:50:52

this has been a solid two months of nothing which i like what's the how big is it

2:51:04

eight percent point eight percent it's not bad

2:51:10

not bad all right let's keep going

2:51:17

beezer nice job beezer is my i didn't say visa is my top one remaining oh it is it's literally the top home

2:51:23

builder right this is why i kept a good chunk of the portfolio um in beezer because i thought man this

2:51:28

is the one i'd like to keep around all right it's gonna be so it's point eight percent

2:51:36

oh or is hov bigger hof h to the izzo um no hope is not bigger right

2:51:46

ah um it's smaller but yeah this one like oh this is this could be a good breakout okay this

2:51:52

is legit because i could see it taking out these highs do i add oh i've been trimming all these

2:51:58

home builders what i add to this you know what another you know what another one is uh wow i don't know about that i don't think i

2:52:05

can add to this new home this one's not bad

2:52:11

if anything i think i'd add to this one

2:52:16

are they buying too all right so i'm seeing the breakout in in beezer which is bullish

2:52:24

and we saw kbh there tall right there

2:52:31

not no no it's not so much taking out the other can these keep running wow

2:52:39

maybe new home anyone buy it

2:52:50

ihp partners 13 did they buy 13 oh they added to their position who are

2:52:56

they that's kind of bullish

2:53:01

i don't know anyone else though bomber bomber bummer bummer no uh oh

2:53:07

they don't have a fund where the hell are they

2:53:18

ice we started to help our partners achieve their investment goals but oh wait what are they doing look at this

2:53:25

picture of the homes what do you what's your investment strategy

2:53:30

oh oh they're not like okay interesting they're like

2:53:35

all right they're a different type of uh interesting they got a stake in the company for

2:53:41

doing something with them oh you know what sorry i'm getting sidetracked here but one thing i noticed i had i had typed into

2:53:46

the ad hoc fundamental are the two companies that barry had

2:53:52

at heroic and units sorry i just want to check these real quick and i guess because we just looked at mac just quickly

2:54:03

i didn't take a peek at that we had typed them in and i didn't get time then i just forgot you'll see me i'll check off stuff right and that'll just keep going then i'll forget to

2:54:09

return to it okay here we go roik market cap 1.4 nice so he's still in a small company

2:54:14

revenue growth sick i've never looked at this county before so let's see but i also this is real estate it's a reit okay let's see um and i don't know the

2:54:22

stock price tart either so let's this will be good i don't really know reit numbers that well you know what i mean when i'm looking at these

2:54:28

these these margins in these metrics gross margin increasing net oh solid net margin

2:54:33

figures 16 18 15. oh that's that's some fat net margin i don't know what

2:54:39

that this one i mean i don't know industry average net margins off the top of my head something i'd have to check tangible book value i feel like with the

2:54:46

reit and financials generally book value is a good a good proxy for value have they been buying back shares no they've been issuing shares because they've been

2:54:52

in growth mode makes sense look at how low revenues are and then you see tangible book go from nine are they paying a dividend they

2:54:58

have to be it's a reit okay so it goes from 12 10 kind of so stable what is earnings doing they're growing i

2:55:04

mean they're they have earnings but they're not growing what you know what i mean why isn't that why isn't equity growing that much what's up

2:55:10

with that if you got positive earnings and you're issuing shares presumably

2:55:16

above book value no why is your book value flat it's kind of weird

2:55:23

right oh because you're paying the dividend of course durr so that makes sense so that's why

2:55:29

the book measured our so the book measured roe takes that into account you know what i mean so um you could have the earnings growth

2:55:35

but if you pay out the earnings then you're not going to have the the you can see the equity grow right which is fine that's perfectly fine

2:55:40

that's why the book manager already has to take into account that dividend because otherwise your company gets penalized for paying a

2:55:45

dividend so that's why you see a lot of the purple and green but it's kind of tailed off past couple years so maybe it's growth has slowed down a little bit oh

2:55:52

you've seen it in the revenues growth has clearly slowed down past couple years all right so earnings

2:55:58

so pretty decent low earnings though uh actually i don't even know what the stock price is right so let's keep going

2:56:04

simple frequency operating cash flow positive operating cash flow is probably common among reits i would think silver for cash flow you think it's

2:56:09

going to be negative because it's growing but positive right now a buck which is close to operating cash flow

2:56:16

do they have additional do reits have additional expenditures that don't fall under cap x

2:56:21

maybe but even net cash flow there you go net cash flow a buck oh that's nice my cash flow is nice no bari probably

2:56:27

yeah i bet imagine barry likes to see the net cash flow for most companies i don't think maxar has some which was which was why i was

2:56:34

it was funny that we both bought it because it was just straight thesis all right so book value 10 bucks i mean

2:56:40

if net cash flow is accurate i don't know what it is but if we saw it was about a buck for free cash flow um that's that's sorry that's what i'm

2:56:47

seeing here i got to keep remember just keep scrolling down i i don't usually scroll down because i like to see everything in the number but

2:56:52

so long as i'm blocking i should remember to keep scrolling down um all right what would i i would have

2:56:57

what would i value this at um i can't say that i would value it

2:57:03

more than fifteen dollars i can't see it even with it maybe if they have really strong revenue growth but see how it's

2:57:09

slowed down i have no insight that like why did it slow down uh if we were here i wonder if the stock

2:57:15

prices track this you know what i mean kind of stumbled a bit like not done much because this looks really good right

2:57:21

that's just like not that much but maybe it picks back up again but even if it picks back up again i it's hard to say

2:57:26

i mean it's earning 40 cents what's the dividend ah so it's b that's the thing you can

2:57:31

see 15 bucks with the dividend you're paying a dividend you're paying a dividend to 78 cents

2:57:38

i can get to 15 easily i could even get to 20. the question is how sustainable is that dividend you know what i mean i don't know okay so that changes things

2:57:46

because people are buying this people you're buying a reit for the dividend that's you're not buying it for much else so

2:57:52

with that in mind it's from looking at this i don't know how stable this dividend could be but um

2:58:00

i can easily i can see more than 50 now with that dividend see i'll pull back a little bit but i

2:58:05

could a 20 max i would say um

2:58:14

15 i say 15. 12 bucks okay that's not bad pretty good

2:58:21

huh all right let's see the actual chart though oh that's pretty good and i said i could

2:58:29

see 20 all right so i can see 20 because of the dividend you can see 15 you're paying 79 cents you people will pay 20 times that maybe even

2:58:36

22 23 like they're you're actually paying that out this isn't just a free cash flow multiple so you're gonna see higher multiples

2:58:41

applied to dividend and i get that um but i can't like i can't see more did it ever go above 20.

2:58:47

look at that even if it's stabled out too oh i almost called this that would have been hard to justify

2:58:53

what was the dividend yeah 15 to 20. i almost got that this would have made a good buying opportunity that i didn't miss because i didn't know

2:58:58

about it but um i'll add it to my i'll add it to my universe there do i have time 9 57 all right so so you

2:59:06

know what i mean like you can get a good feel for reits because even though i don't know reits it's pretty damn similar you don't use

2:59:12

book value and um and like i was just in the ballpark i'm pretty i'm pretty happy about that

2:59:17

because it was that's what i was thinking it's hard to see 15 until i saw the dividend and oh i could see the dividends i could see people paying that multiple

2:59:23

i just don't know how like it is to to sustain nor did the market the market wasn't sure either

2:59:28

because it's such an it's such an early stages they sold off like i i even i don't know if you'll be able to keep paying this

2:59:34

dividend and of course this is the case with a lot of reits so they just sold off and um but then it clearly it

2:59:41

and look at the longer term chart it did look really good long term see it's following that growth trend you know what i mean that just

2:59:52

relican unit i'm going to add those both and then let's do you do i have time for unit come on

3:00:00

let's go let's go let's go let's go

3:00:08

gonna be the same analysis like it's not attractive right now but five six bucks it would be and that's why you

3:00:14

add it to the list you track it and then if it sells back again you remember all right i've already bought this back in the day and uh

3:00:19

we thought fair value was like 15 20 bucks and that's where it traded too so that was a pretty good all right so look at

3:00:25

this watch negative 10 this one's tougher

3:00:30

but um okay so revenues rapidly growing but kind of tapered off

3:00:36

this year makes sense with this last quarter probably huge self gross margin dropping off but fat gross margins

3:00:41

specialized reits is it what is it like uh oh i don't have um all right forget the

3:00:48

business i'll just maybe is it a mall or something not that it matters

3:00:53

what was the other one i just want to see what type of read it is retail opportunity so were they

3:00:59

self-interested especially isn't that crucial of grocery anchored shopping centers oh nice pick oh nice pick grocery anchored

3:01:07

shopping centers nice pick grocery stores i didn't think

3:01:13

about that one good pick i don't know reits but uh

3:01:18

they're still shopping centers but they're grocery anchored nice one i was going to say you know what i mean

3:01:24

like wreath's tough but if there's an angle or there was a covet angle was the other one unit

3:01:32

unity

3:01:37

oh i know this one

3:01:43

has been chosen mission critical communications infrastructure these are good reads i don't even know

3:01:48

these existed you know what i mean there's reach for other stuff you kind of forget like there's uh didn't that paper company like iron

3:01:54

mountain turn into a re2 like there's not like you think rit you think real estate investment choices like there's other types of

3:02:00

ways to play this is like that's why it's a special specialized sub industry ah good play huh nice job all right this

3:02:07

is why it's good to look this up i wouldn't even thought about that or to play the read angle for i mean wireless communications right

3:02:13

knowing nothing else about the company of the industry but like oh i think that's interesting

3:02:18

cool okay let's keep look before we look at the chart this is tough though right i have no idea i don't know tangible book very heavily

3:02:25

leveraged revenue growing a billion dollars that's that's good size much bigger than the other company

3:02:31

um had some positive earnings but a huge loss probably a write-off and you could expect more it gets tough

3:02:36

but some simpler free cash flow it's not paying a dividend oh it's paying a dividend it's a wreath come on kind of a fat did it volatile though i

3:02:43

was paying 240 130.

3:02:49

all right so um oh it's 10 01. oh no

3:02:56

i got to finish this hold on

3:03:01

all right um let me see if you see in freak sorry sorry sorry silly if you can't see what i'm talking

3:03:07

about so i'm in symbol free cash flow right here um about a buck but what matters to

3:03:12

these are reits so i mean i look at there is free cash flow here and there's net cash flow here but the dividend the

3:03:18

dividend is was 240 wow 240 130 57 so it's dropping down

3:03:23

um damn oh this is tough i'm just gonna have the

3:03:29

other tangible i don't have tangible book value to to to back me up here you know but i'm gonna say

3:03:37

so it should be whatever multiple you apply to that dividend should be discounted because of leverage could be a huge growth opportunities too because

3:03:43

of that you know what i mean it's tough to say for sure

3:03:48

what do you think these ones are always tougher do i have ebitda

3:03:55

okay i'm going to say uh wow remember 240 max so this duck price was definitely much

3:04:01

higher than we just saw with robot because that's a fat dividend i'm going to say uh

3:04:12

this is tough i try i try to like i try to get it right it's like a little bit of fun to try to guess with that try to guess what the charts gonna like

3:04:19

the charts gonna look like i'm trying to guess what what fair value is and then it

3:04:24

oftentimes the chart can reflect it that's what i mean that's why the charts can be helpful people say oh it's silly but yeah it's charts often in the ballpark of

3:04:30

what fair value is so let's go with uh oh this is down this is

3:04:41

i'm gonna go with uh oh this is tough

3:04:47

25 10 bucks right now let's see where it traded surely it traded much higher than that

3:04:53

right

3:04:58

20. so the market priced in that dividend was unsustainable

3:05:04

did it actually so that's the thing it was so it's such a new company in 2016 didn't actually pay a 2.40 dividend and you're telling me the stock

3:05:11

price was uh 18 bucks that makes me think that that's not the actual dividend i'd have to look

3:05:16

that up but i don't i find it hard to believe oh maybe this was 2015 2016 20 bucks

3:05:25

but super speculative you know what i mean so i applied probably too fat of a multiple because of the risk i wouldn't um

3:05:36

look at that dividend right there you can't do that either yeah okay should have should have adjusted it for that leverage just a

3:05:42

little bit more it's risky it's risky i can't do much with that i don't i'm less

3:05:48

intrigued by this one although i added for the that angle that can wireless communications angle that's kind of interesting

3:05:55

plus look how low it got that's cool and a double dipped in late april you

3:06:01

didn't see that too much it's only and it's only doubled right but okay now we got a couple of reits back pocketed

3:06:07

um did he have any other reits was rogue the ticker that's sick that's

3:06:12

a nice ticker oh we're after 10 oh no where's that sion ah what am i doing

3:06:18

come on i just what i just did that to get me to sign i'm always looking remember how i said i i was i was dabbling in some reach just

3:06:25

to diversify and i didn't have i don't know reits so i was like looking for things like looking for things to do and i'm like oh i'm out of my element here

3:06:32

and so i'm excited by how high so he's only got two he's dealt in a couple others in the past that i had back pocketed

3:06:38

um i came across a new one too rlg which he didn't i came across that elsewhere but um he

3:06:43

had a couple other ones cplg and another one so whenever he does it i'll add it to my list okay but that was it for those ones okay

3:06:52

did i say add that to the universe okay so i'll do that so we got a couple new names okay cool all right so we went over today i hope you don't mind

3:06:58

that's cheers thanks for hanging in there i know it was all over the place today

3:07:04

that's okay um we still didn't get through those damn charts you know what i mean see how much of this is just like screening through

3:07:10

existing companies i know i keep saying that but i'm increasingly surprised i think it's just because i'm still trying to get my bearings you know what i mean

3:07:15

i feel like it's going to subside and then how much how many times can you look at the same chart because the companies in your

3:07:20

portfolio don't change that much but right now because i haven't looked in a while every time i'm coming across the company i'm pulling up the chart

3:07:26

so now it's clearly taking me longer than i expected it could be it could be a couple more weeks of this so i apologize if it's

3:07:32

if it sucks but um i'll get up to speed and then and then i think some more structure would help like

3:07:37

going through daily routines and maybe weekly charts and stuff like that but i'll get i'll keep giving it some more thought

3:07:43

but uh yeah hope you had a good time see on wednesday have no idea what we're going to be doing we'll see what the market brings us and uh yeah have a good

3:07:49

night all right peace out
