[Music]
1:38
y'all [Music]
1:51
those calls
1:57
[Music]
2:20
oh [Music]
2:34
up [Music]
2:48
cheers cheers everybody today we will not be starting with the uh what i call the dashboard well
2:54
first let me take a step today for once we actually have some what i consider pretty positive gamestop
3:01
news huh look at this it's up after hours nothing like crazy crazy crazy or anything like that but we
3:06
do have to start with this not just to talk about it but i actually need to do some research on this because
3:11
uh a major monster stake taken um over it looks like a lot of the
3:17
position was built over the past couple weeks um i had damn the damn stream a little bit slow but um
3:23
by uh rc ventures and it looks like this guy's a is a billionaire and um but he is involved more importantly
3:29
he's involved with uh he co-founded uh chewie that which was required by what was the pet spot well we're gonna look into it right now but
3:36
he's the type and it was a 13d that he filed like an activist position that he took in here right so this is big news
3:43
like legit so i i just got the news i was out and about i was on a walk with my with my daughter and i just got the news while we were
3:49
walking right away back and so i saw it on the phone i'm like holy [ __ ] that's a big what caught my attention was the big size steak i actually didn't know much i
3:55
had i didn't know rc ventures right who i never heard of that no one's heard of that but it must be his personal fun or
4:00
whatever and then i saw who was back in it and then i'm like holy [ __ ] i got a good thing there's a stream tonight because i got to research this i got to
4:07
research this asap but my quick take is and i haven't even looked up on it but i've chatted with
4:12
a few folks but sounds like he might be um like a great potential i mean he's a 13d it's not a partner
4:18
right but he could have some great ideas for um a company in gamestop's position and um
4:24
i tried to quickly look up the 13d while i was on my phone but you try to look up look at some sec
4:30
filings while you're on your phone that shit's a mess so sometimes they they'll post some
4:35
commentary within the 13d itself but um um so we'll see i i couldn't see
4:40
anything so maybe there's nothing there but if he's i don't think he's publicly commented on it nor would he right if he's building his position he'd
4:46
he'd take his time but now that he's filed a 13d we gotta look into it i don't know i don't know anything about this guy but
4:52
maybe he's uh maybe the plan is to talk about it at some point in the future in the near future maybe even with the consoles coming out but uh it could get
4:58
people's attention like we are there's already a billionaire invested in gamestop would uh was it donald foss is his name
5:04
um let's just pull he's been invested in um since i think mars march is when he
5:10
filed his uh 13 i think it's a 13g for him but uh i mean this is the biggest this
5:16
is the biggest fund of anyone uh you get the institutions right but this is bigger than hessian
5:22
permit it's it's bigger than must and foss it's bigger than scion it's a huge it's a huge position
5:28
and um and just depending on what this guy's background is it sounds like people might know who he
5:34
is but i didn't i didn't follow true that closely but i didn't see that it was fine let's let's look this [ __ ] up
5:39
what am i going to just speculate here we got three hours let's get going huh so let's um rc ventures and if we pull up um
5:48
quote the filing 13 d i actually just had looked at uh i've been looking after hours
5:53
i i did it like the past two fridays i didn't do it today oh i did do it today i did it at like four or ten
5:58
i'm like there's been no filings recently right and i looked like 410 and obviously this one hadn't been filed yet
6:03
but i'm like um especially if you have an announcement on a friday after hours or something
6:09
remember the stock price was a big last week too on on friday and so i was thinking last friday i'm like oh
6:14
someone's gonna file something um after hours today and so i was like watching closely after i was last week
6:20
and then no one found like what the hell and then uh and then but the price action the past two weeks
6:25
has kind of looked like i mean it's been up a little bit right and we see this and it's not alone but it's it's kind of a unique chart in this regard if you have
6:31
other charts that have kind of been plotting along like the past two weeks it kind of looked like someone could have been building a position but to be
6:36
honest i've said that before and i was wrong about it in game stop too and i'm like oh it kind of looks like someone's building a position
6:41
um and uh but this time i'm like i don't know and then no one filed on friday i'm like [ __ ] no no one's building the position but we
6:48
got it today and i think you need to follow the 13d this thing's riding up man uh i think you have to follow the 13d
6:55
within like um 10 days or something is it 10 days with it 13 uh like a 13g 13d
7:00
when you're taking a 5 position on the company i think you need to file within i want to say 10 days of when you establish the position so
7:07
i but even still i i thought there was so much action last week that it could have been filed last week so anyway we
7:13
got it today and then if you open up the 13d and you scroll down just a heads up if
7:18
you don't know this you scroll down to the bottom if it's a 13d it's an active um position in the
7:24
company not a passive position then they they past 60 days it's i was going to say i
7:30
started on my phone and i'm like um how many how far back does it go it's past 60 days they have to file their
7:35
um the i actually don't even know exactly i think they got to file the transactions that they had within the
7:40
stock itself but they may have also had to file communications that they have with management it could be maybe bar if you check out burries he
7:47
included all his back and forth with management over like the prior 12 months or something
7:52
so that's what i was quickly looking for to just see number one when the position was being built and you can see here he's building the position over the past
8:01
three week or is it two weeks or three weeks
8:06
all right looks like mostly two weeks but um and this is 60 days okay so this actually answers my question because my question
8:12
was did they only if it was shorter than that then maybe he had been building the position up longer and he only had to do the past two weeks
8:17
or something but this clearly says 60 days so this might be the extent of his position i didn't add all these up
8:25
i didn't add all these up but if you add all those up it looks like uh two four six eight ten
8:31
it's at least it's it's a good chunk of the position it's all the position is it
8:36
ryan cohen what is this it was he doing it into so this is what going to look into it like i saw the rc ventures and then i saw ryan oh
8:41
it's ryan cohn adventures right rc ventures i didn't i'm an idiot um
8:47
what was going on here did he he build the steak personally and then sell it to rc ventures there was an owner
8:52
reflecting an internal boom there you go interesting so here's i haven't seen this before not that i i
8:59
although i do you know we haven't been doing it i can't keep on forget it sometimes to do in the stream but if you check out fintel right here
9:04
the activist i would have definitely done it during the stream but um i i do it as not not as often as i
9:11
check open on site you know we do an open side of every damn stream but i try to do this every couple days at least it kind of got screwed up because when the quarter end
9:18
filings are happening this gets this just gets bombarded but this is actually how i came across it today i came across it um
9:24
right here right here see rc ventures because because because rc ventures wasn't an
9:29
insider yet right there this is an initial stake it's not green or red this is how they do it on fintel it's red if they were trimming or adding
9:36
or uh or green excuse me red if they were trimming or or selling out completely or green if
9:41
they were adding or building whatever and it was just obviously it's not lit up anything and i'm like oh [ __ ] it's a new thing and i'm like rc ventures what
9:46
the hell is that and um uh and then i saw this i saw this 5.8
9:52
and i just had nine percent stick i'm like holy [ __ ] um so anyway then i'm like all right
9:57
gotta go check the filing and then that brought me over here but i was wondering um yeah what rc ventures was never heard
10:02
of it before like you see must like must to must asset management they had taken that
10:08
position but i had no idea who they were and then i looked into them and they were an asian fund and i checked that they
10:14
have a website and stuff but i i never heard of them before i couldn't get it couldn't get a feel on what the plan was or any insight that's
10:20
just another fun who owns some shares that if they hold them tightly then it's a lower float all right so we come back here and
10:26
then he was looks like he's building the stake in his individual capacity i don't understand
10:31
what's this how did he what's this august 13th approximate price per year six dollars
10:37
and 17 cents what is that um the only thing i could think of
10:45
i have no idea what this is well this price stock price was never read that the only thing that this is the very first transaction
10:51
maybe he had had built this position previously and um and that this is just
10:58
him like noting uh with it to just be as transparent as possible i had 141 000
11:04
shares as of august 13th and my average cost base was 6 17. that's how i interpret this but i
11:09
uh i don't know i'm not a expert on 13 d filings but that's my guess is that was his personal average cost basis and then
11:15
after that he's like boom boom boom boom boom then here come the subsequent transactions that actually happened within 60 days just to guess i don't
11:21
know it's not that important but it caught my eye because we know the stock price hasn't been there so then you see build build build build build
11:27
and this it's not it's not the bulk of the volume right because we know
11:35
we can check out what that volume was right here
11:42
and it it's just a fraction of it right so even let's take august 18 okay so actually it's a good chunk of volume
11:47
august 18th 3 4 almost 800k
11:54
on wednesday august 18th so you know what i mean it's it's uh it's a good chunk of the day's volume
12:00
but it's not all of it uh let's just i was just more just curious about that how about august 19th
12:05
200 400 500 so he's doing a good job of adding of building the position this is good um
12:12
i mean this guy knows he's doing right he's a billionaire um
12:21
but i'm just curious as to whether he was dominating the volume but he wasn't and it was still rising but maybe that's how that works someone's building a
12:27
large stake it could uh it impacts the price and then what happened so then he transferred the shares to rc ventures
12:37
but then he built then he then you started buying a couple shares four rc ventures on august 27th what's that when
12:42
was that it was yesterday [ __ ] this is recent and then um
12:48
august 20 oh so this was okay then the sale then the transfer and then 100 300 400
12:53
500k um always today okay just a fraction of it
13:01
but still okay all right so now i want to read a bit about him i feel like he might be commonly known but just not
13:06
like not by me um and again i didn't follow chewie that closely but let's let's just now that i'm just legit the first time i've sat at
13:12
the computer since i got this new so let's actually look at the 13d oh this thing does i think that is this headband i
13:18
used to be all about headbands right now i just i picked up a new one in this one i i've i've uh i got the long hair right
13:24
i grew i grew up my hair back in the day and i i needed the headband just to get through the day so i picked up a new one
13:31
but now my it uh just tested it out let's see how it goes um okay let's go up this is just
13:38
your usual stuff 5.5.8 for the first find that's when you see 5.8 and nine percent you need to file these 13ds 13gs
13:45
at five percent that's what i mean to see the initial find that nine percent i was like what he must have must have been happening
13:51
within the past ten days that he breached the five percent we could pencil through it but who cares and then um but it's just it's it's it's
13:58
saying something you know what i mean and um okay so is ryan cohen i have one eight um it is a 13d so it's
14:05
an active state but i looked quickly i didn't see anything in here he's talking about [ __ ]
14:14
purpose of the transaction you often see this it looks it's uh this is like boilerplate what from what i could tell is boilerplate language
14:21
when acquired were undervalued and represented an attractive investment opportunity
14:27
but that's all it is you know what i mean a lot of this is just boilerplate stuff so there wasn't anything in here which is fine it's um but it's i was just hoping for a
14:33
little bit more just for my for selfish reason to know just so i could better understand what the plan is
14:39
um okay but let's see from time to time to increase or decrease its position in the issuer through
14:48
except as otherwise disclose reporting boards do not have any present or plan or proposal which would relate to results in the matter set forth would
14:54
have probably buying the company outright or she's probably said i'm not no plans to do that tend to review the their investment in
15:00
the issuer on a periodic basis from time to time to engage in discussions with management in the board so i mean this
15:05
is standard stuff if you follow 13d you're probably going to be doing this right now time to engage in discussions with
15:10
management on the board shareholders blah blah blah blah blah boilerplate depending on the various factors including without limitation the issue
15:16
is financial pin issuers financial position investment strategy and execution that strategy
15:22
may in the future take chats with respect to their respective investments here blah blah blah okay so it's all boilerplate board composition or operations and strategy
15:29
of the issue are including oh okay do we have something here something specific to gamestop
15:35
all right let's check this depending on various factors including without limitation the issuer's financial position and investment strategy
15:42
and the execution of that strategy at the the price levels that are all the different variables the
15:47
reporting person's main future takes attachments with respect to their respective investments in the issuer as they deem appropriate
15:52
including without making proposals concerning changes to the capitalization ownership structure board composition or
15:59
operations or strategy of the issue it this too strikes me as boilerplate but uh including by independently exploring
16:05
plans or proposals advocated by others or variations thereon
16:11
purchasing additional securities of the issue or sell right taking more market action selling some or all of its
16:16
securities all right so a lot of it's boilerplate some stuff
16:23
independently exploring plans or proposals advocated by others or variations around it's kind of interesting right i don't know that i've
16:29
seen that too frequently but again the whole thing strikes me as boilerplate but even still okay so but not much else
16:36
the biggest thing biggest takeaway is just the size of the steak that's all and then now let's look into uh ryan cone
16:41
and anything with rc ventures really i look they don't have anything else so if you click on their name here this is
16:47
what i did rc ventures there's nothing else and what we can also do is pop open the um watch this you do scc
16:55
name rc ventures there's a couple of them uh which let's
17:01
guess i'll go without florida ah [ __ ] oh that's it yes right all right
17:06
this is the first filing this is the first final did he just spin
17:12
it up interesting
17:18
oh [ __ ] 2005 is this
17:28
same company probably not right
17:35
it's a scan document from 2005 this is probably something separate just curious doesn't matter mark
17:43
seely okay someone different just curious doesn't matter okay okay okay all right so nothing
17:50
first filing for rc ventures all right and um and then so we're probably not gonna see [ __ ] right i saw this stuff too but um
17:55
as it turned out not not the right not the right rc ventures um different i think they're given
18:03
financing companies in bangladesh yet saw that so there's probably not even a website it looks like you just spun this up you
18:09
know what i mean just um let's check this small business this
18:15
ain't it so there's not gonna be out here we're just gonna look into his background that's where we're gonna spend most of our um
18:22
all of our time on this there's nothing here right why would he why would he make a website for this he wouldn't
18:27
there's not gonna be [ __ ] i just wanted to see if people were talking about it but it doesn't look like there's anything all right so let's just look into um
18:35
we're still gonna ryan go so we're gonna see um
18:42
all right yeah co-founder is e-commerce company chewy right they sold you know what surprised me is that um it
18:48
was founded in 2011 sold in 2017 i didn't realize how how short of a time period that
18:54
passed between one chewie when they founded it and when they sold it holy [ __ ] right is this there some sort of record is
19:00
there some database that tracks this of um like uh i mean i guess facebook reached a billion pretty quickly right but um
19:06
just that we know there's a whole bunch of billion dollar companies out there right but the speed at which from from inception to to that billion
19:12
dollar valuation uh i don't know there's just there probably is something out there right oh didn't i open crunch base did i not open
19:18
crunch base ah i meant to open that it doesn't matter but um you know what i mean 2011 2017 that's no joke so
19:24
and i as i recall and i'm not that i wish ever more dialed into chewie but of course it
19:29
wasn't like your classic values type of company so i wasn't too dialed in but as i recall petsmart i didn't remember petsmart buying it and everyone
19:35
applauding them is that this is a even though i saw the price tag and everyone's saying that this was a tremendous acquisition
19:40
i believe if you if that's not accurate let me know but um all right so let's see this 2011
19:46
the age of 25. i remember mr chewie i did see that says inspiration picking the pet category they went with the pet the pet counter
19:52
and i've i asked my wife i'm like hey do you know what you i mean i know i'm truly right but i'm like you know chewie and she's like yeah yeah yeah
19:57
from the commercials so i'll always whenever i come across a company you always see me lament about being an individual investor
20:02
i don't know how to pronounce things i've never heard of things um i don't even really chat with many folks
20:08
so who who were tracking the same stuff right and i said so i'll ask oh like oh we
20:13
were talking about uh maybe i mentioned this on stream dbi dsw that company i said you still shop at
20:18
dsw right and she and just today actually she i think she she might have got she got something i think she got some shoes or she ordered
20:24
it online or something i'm like there you go so he's still shopping there right so that's a good that's my due diligence of uh what is uh
20:30
phil what's fisher call it um um ah [ __ ] what's that word what's that funny word he's got for it uh that where
20:36
we go around asking people whatever but that's more so for management but um so anyway
20:41
i asked and she goes oh yeah i know i know chewie from um from the commercials i said okay okay yep just make a chair
20:47
um by 2016 okay so let's look at his originally approached over 100
20:52
venture capital firms and was rejected by all of them 2013 secured the companies first look at this
20:58
wow what a what a quick turnaround huh they really crushed it you know there's probably someone that knows that has a better understanding of the
21:03
narrative that unfolded here but um i mean i just see how quickly it is how
21:09
quickly it grew and it has been a huge success that that that in itself speaks to me but i'm sure there's a better maybe there's a
21:16
magazine article written about this that that goes into greater detail i should i'll check seek and alpha here in just a minute too
21:21
um petsmart purchased 3.3 billion the largest e-commerce there you go so that's a huge the largest e-commerce
21:27
acquisition of all time name cohen it was 40 under 40 vox enemy up yep yep yep that's mark all right
21:32
in march 2018 he stepped down to the ceo too so this is so it might i want to read more about him but like
21:37
this dude knows his [ __ ] in the e-commerce world he he does kind of seem like he he's
21:43
forward thinking and so and it's a 13d he filed which is important right because he may be getting involved and interacting with
21:48
management and [ __ ] um and it may act as a bit of a visionary of source of course they
21:54
probably have their own management has their own plan the existing investors have their own plan you've seen me talk about it in the
21:59
videos right it's not as if they're they're they're blind here walking forward but nevertheless someone of this stature you think
22:05
is a huge addition especially a negative sentiment around gamestop you hear me talk about how heavy this
22:12
negative sentiment is right it's just ridiculous and like it feels like the people like the handful of us on this stream
22:18
and a couple of the handful investors i've mentioned on my videos and stuff there's like eight of us who are like bullish on gamestop but can see the even
22:24
the potential of it but everyone else on wall street is like it's pooh-poohed and it's like it's ridiculous like it's beneath them
22:31
but someone like this like even bari you know what people even make in front of barry's like what the hell making fun of bari like who that who are you
22:38
and uh make fun of make fun of roaring kitty that's okay oh hi right but uh making fun of barbie
22:44
so it's like these deep valley investors who gives a [ __ ] but then you get someone like this like someone who cl their uh what is
22:50
he's 25 is that well born 86 millennial right and then like uh but then a huge hugely successful company and um
22:58
and then they're getting involved with gamestop in this terrible terrible year where everyone has given up on it and there's no future blah blah blah but
23:04
then he steps into it that in itself at least starts have people start talking about this you know what i mean so
23:10
you'd expect this i mean i don't know how i someone like that chewie was a huge i
23:17
mean it was a big deal right so i expect this that you think this people going to be talking about this right and maybe that can help spin turn this narrative a bit try to uh
23:24
spin it more in the positive fashion it kind of gets the and then in two weeks we're getting earnings right they just announced it um
23:30
uh on wednesday that they're gonna announce it uh well like ten days ten eleven days two september 9th whenever it is so like
23:36
this can get the the conversation started right with it before evenings are even released and then uh i don't know so then we
23:42
still have to see what he has to say and everything like that but i just talk about the how heavy this negative sentiment is
23:47
and you just need to p people to stop thinking so bearish about it and this is a big step forward
23:53
and even though we know nothing except this damn filing but i'm telling you it's so undervalued and incentive so
23:58
bearish that uh it's yeah we'll see so i expect more let's see if we get more articles about this next week
24:04
and um and um all the other big firms picking up on it and talking about it and i'm very curious to see what people
24:10
have to say about it too i'd love if he talks about it too and um oh we got a question oh hey derek
24:15
cheers mate i think there are too many cooks in the kitchen with all these activists even if they bring so i don't know about
24:21
that so so derek's asking if there's too many cooks in the kitchen with all these activist investors even if they bring
24:27
great experience i mean that's a good that's a worthwhile question right that's a good question what i would say is uh and there's our
24:34
there are a bunch of activist investors now right these aren't all 13g like barry was 13 d although now he's under five percent so it's not it doesn't
24:41
still count but hester and permanent clearly activists right they just just got a position in the on the board and now this guy but um
24:49
that's conceivable that could happen if you have any if you have any examples yourself of having seen this in the past i'd be quite curious of that where
24:54
there's too many activists getting involved and maybe they clash or something we were just looking at a company on wednesday on the stream
25:00
that uh there was one for i don't even remember what was that i don't remember the company one activist was talk like trying to
25:06
hey go on a company on the management of a company in another big uh fund had a strong b riley had a
25:12
strong position and then the activist investor ended up giving up and going away we saw that on the street i can't remember the damn company b
25:17
riley what was it uh it was something they were inside of buying racing anyway it's totally conceivable that that could happen i don't think that's the case
25:23
here and my reason would be um because of what i just said about the importance of the sentiment shift here
25:28
and because everyone views gamestop and it's legacy business as antiquate and everything like this someone like this getting involved i
25:35
would think would trump any concerns that one might have about these types of things but indeed
25:41
if he if his views truly clashed with the thing with the the ideas being shared by bari and um
25:47
hester impermit then that's yes that's something to be discussed but until then i i don't see reason to to to be concerned
25:54
about that but a good question and something something to ask but um but now nine percent no he's the
26:01
biggest investor isn't that crazy you know what i mean i mean these heston permanent work and even bari they've been invested forever especially heston permanent i
26:08
think um and then this guy just steps in with the biggest position i i would always surprise me that i mean hester and permit they're not a
26:14
gigantic fun but they get a good sized stake for i don't know what percentage of their fun it is but i was always thought barry
26:20
would take a larger position but um and then he went back under five percent didn't buy anymore that even
26:25
it's his top position his top stock position excuse me in his portfolio but even still i always thought where are all the where are all
26:32
the activist investors taking a bigger stake in this and to be honest it was a little bit concerning for me because as obvious as
26:38
is like blatantly cheap as this seems to me and i always thought why aren't more people talking about it why are more people
26:43
billionaires or big fans taking a stick it's it's too small for a lot of huge huge funds but even still no one was
26:49
even even talking about it or doing anything with it then uh uh and even though i don't know this guy
26:54
like if someone like carl icon got involved that was what i was thinking remember he got burned on blockbuster he got blurred burned up and so right
27:01
and everyone makes this comparison to blockbuster i don't even but he got burned on it didn't it didn't
27:06
pan out it wasn't totally it kind of wasn't the management team like kind of fighting fighting him on things and stuff and
27:11
so he kind of got burned but i was always thinking what if carl got involved here just saw the obvious cash flows to be to be uh earned here and uh but he
27:18
didn't and everything anyway so now i'm rambling here but you know me that's that's what i do especially when it comes to gamestop so then i was just
27:24
like ah nobody and so i don't know this guy but his expertise i think would trump any concerns i might have about that about them clash i also
27:30
not so sure they would clash i don't let's not assume that not that you are you're not assuming that i get that but um they might all be on the same
27:36
page and then maybe this guy is just um he's just adding to it you know what i mean he's um he's like he's a
27:43
just uh or maybe he has brand new ideas i don't know but uh for now i'll withhold judgment on that front but and i just view this as
27:50
um completely bullish like uh not bullish but i mean like positive completely positive and i
27:56
but um yeah i mean what if hester and permit came out with uh like a a news release
28:02
or a press release saying like don't listen to ryan cohen or something i'd be like oh [ __ ] then then different ball game right um
28:10
but um yeah we'll see i'll be very curious about those maybe he says what if he comes out next week and he
28:15
goes um and he agrees with what barry was saying in that press release that um i shared in the video of very praising
28:21
management during the vote for the board and then he's like they're on the right path this is great i got a couple additional ideas
28:26
let's do this and it's like see ya look out shorts right um you know what else i was thinking too
28:36
we still gotta we'll go we're gonna look some more into ryan cohen here but um uh it's such a big position right reduce
28:42
float now right in theory in theory these people can all sell i don't it's not like it's permanently locked up or anything like
28:47
that but let's say he's 13d he's in it right and that's another six million shares off the table for the shorts
28:53
um so that float that float's shrinking and uh just another thing i just uh i
28:59
know people will be talking about that too right but um just such a big steak you know what i
29:04
mean it's more meaningful because it's such a big steak how many times can i say that in one stream all right so before we do that you know
29:10
i just like to check um chewie you know like
29:16
let's check let's check a seeking alpha article at the time they were um
29:22
seeking goes way back right let's see it should right
29:29
what 2019 see what i mean that's the earliest seeking off article is 2019
29:34
what is this how can that be
29:44
wait it's just petsmart doesn't trade anymore right
29:50
okay wait petsmart they go under chewy right yeah yeah yeah okay
29:57
okay i don't know i don't understand that
30:05
holy [ __ ] what a nice chart huh
30:10
holy toledo oh what happened oh did they oh did what happened did they um
30:15
is that when they that doesn't matter did they do like a
30:21
ticker change or something because with petsmart and stuff it doesn't matter okay i was just curious [ __ ] so can i not uh
30:26
look at this chart though that looks nice
30:32
that looks nice [ __ ] how do i find these old articles i
30:39
can't find the old ones ah all right let's see this the larger sale level of e-commerce
30:45
company backed by venture capital acquired for 3.35 billion tops of 3 billion that won't pay for jet
30:56
no comments on it damn this i'm looking forward to the articles
31:02
that will be written about this because i'm so out of date on chewie and that i just know that it was really like hyped up you know and a lot
31:08
of stuff is hyped up but like legitimately hyped up by people that i respected um
31:17
who talked it up you know i think there was someone on seeking alpha now that i think about it
31:26
i forget who it was was it balloon i think bloom talked it up actually jeremy blew bloom i think he talked
31:31
about it at the time i forget uh but i can't how can i track that down i don't feel like tracking
31:37
that down right now but i i he knows this [ __ ] okay sorry um all right what the hell damn um
31:57
so just read just a couple of this wait what happened in
32:02
oh yeah what was that 2019 all right let's just read a couple just real quick
32:07
and then um
32:13
maybe a couple of bios or something like that there you go ryan cohen started a company they took on his own
32:18
boom january of this year oh that's a good one forbes this year that's good
32:31
oh he has a website oh [ __ ] sick all right we won't watch
32:38
the i won't bore you on the stream with me watching videos you know what i mean i mean i'm reading [ __ ]
32:43
i had this is actual research that i'm doing right now though i just i want to have a better feel for it i wouldn't do this for all companies
32:49
right but it's because it's because it's a huge position um all right so he's got his own website
32:55
all right so that's going to be helpful these they've compiled everything in one single boom that's set keep that open
33:04
all right acquiring true 3.3 i just want to see some commentary on how well petsmart was doing the fast growing pet food and product
33:10
site chewy.com can we also check that by the way
33:24
i've had i haven't bought anything i haven't bought anything from here
33:30
all right just curious bad stuff um the deal is huge one by any standard
33:36
bigger than walmart yep uh one of the fastest growing e-commerce sites on the planet wow
33:43
a billion in revenue last year and what was only its fifth year okay founded by ryan cohen michael day
33:49
and built a cult following for its excellent customer service large selection and fast shipping and it quietly raised at least 236 million
33:56
excuse me it's under the radar status was probably aided by the fact that it was headquartered in fort lauderdale florida
34:02
not a big market yep the deal seems like the type of bet the company acquisition by a traditional retailer that commerce
34:08
focus hook yeah sick okay they knew what they were doing huh
34:13
um actually jet.com was a huge deal but it represented a fraction of walmart's yep yep yep yep
34:18
it's attention to a quiet tuesday but okay so not much in here it's kind of looking for a little bit of background on uh their process or
34:25
how revolutionary it was but it was did they just crush it as a business you know what i mean like huge selection uh good customer service
34:33
that's the usual business stuff right um nevertheless i mean it's a market that everyone knew about to spin up a company in 2011 and
34:39
somehow dominate that market you got amazon you're competing with two we'll get to that article but even still
34:45
oh when was this one what is this april 2019 petsmart is moving forward the plan to take it's
34:50
take public it's fast growing online
35:01
oh okay so they pestici a while before they ipo did oh okay oh you don't see that too man
35:07
online presence okay the move was built as a way for petsmart to establish a robust online presence sound familiar that supplemented its
35:13
sprawling brick and mortar footprint of 600 stores sound familiar how about 5 000 stores
35:20
sick sick last year however petsmart spun off a portion of its equity in chewie okay so
35:26
it's spun off a portion of integrity intuition and set the stage for a potential public offering or sale who said they didn't approve such a
35:32
transfer oh scale petsmart was acquired in an 8.7
35:37
wow holy [ __ ] testimony was acquired i
35:42
didn't real i forgot that you know what i mean like i tracked this stuff but i can't maintain it all
35:48
in 2015 and then they bought it oh it wasn't
35:54
public when they acquired and then they spun it out got it okay okay password will continue to be the company's majority shareholder after the
36:00
ipo which was launched by two college dropouts who met in the java chat room sick the online only pep business quickly and
36:07
quietly gained traction today is responsible for 45 of the dog and cat food wow 45
36:12
with against amazon which puts it on par with amazon according to market wow huh
36:18
online products still represent a fraction of overall spending that is changing look at this you see what i mean this i mean pet food you know what i
36:23
mean they um right i mean pet food i'm just i'm
36:30
trying to think i mean it's not as uh you don't you can't download pet food right but you do you can imagine why a lot of
36:36
people might pick up pet food while they're when they're stored food shopping or doing anything really whereas gaming it's a click of a button
36:42
so it's not a perfect it's not a comparison i'm not just saying that but i just mean um ryan and michael were on on the cusp
36:49
of this and like being how can we start causing people to buy this stuff online from us so
36:55
what how much more can i read about this guy you know what i mean it's pretty clear what else could i unless he started talking about gaming i
37:00
guess that would be sick but i doubt that he's himself a pet parent to thai least apricot tea cup poodle capitalized on
37:06
the big bucks that pen owners are willing to spend on their family pets and the company's regulator it describes
37:12
a phenomenon of pet humanization which helps to drive sales on items like grass-fed beef and orthopedic yep
37:18
better better products for customers pet parents increasingly view pets as part of the family and are willing to spend
37:24
increasingly larger dollar amounts on higher quality foods and services for those family members okay
37:31
uh chewie offers free shipping on orders over 49 and says they can ship okay okay all right that's good all right now
37:37
we kind of got a little bit of background on it i already feel like i'm learning a bit more about it so that's good appeal raises funds to help manage debt
37:43
load all right that other one was a good article from the anticipated 41.
37:50
not much here this is just looks like facts right here here are the details of what's happening should we compete with
37:55
amazon and buffalo blue buffalo pep products haven't you heard of that which required by general mills
38:00
trying to foster customer loyalty sound familiar 60 million power up rewards members uh
38:06
an effort which has included sending bereavement cards to shoppers who have recently lost a pet wow okay
38:12
wow uh the co-founders sees plenty of growth left for the
38:17
company and long gone are the companies early days when it's struggled to attract capital sick they talk about that narrative
38:24
right the importance of the narrative let's say it's a 13d so we expect him to get involved to some degree but let's say
38:30
like i mean he built this position in two weeks you know what i mean like maybe there's a plan here leading up to the consoles which would be sick right that
38:36
would be awesome that's always been what we're talking about here like this is the opportunity uh the cash flow is right to protect the
38:41
downside but the console refresh itself people gonna be coming into your stores to to to buy the consoles they want to see
38:47
what you're offering the bundles maybe test stuff out like this is the time to re-engage with the customers to see
38:52
what they like test different things i know the tulsa stores and everything like that but that's a little bit different um maybe he's maybe cohen's going to
38:59
step in here and be like hey here's some here's some [ __ ] we can do right off the bat um
39:05
in the next couple months in in what i'm getting at is at the attract capital is what i started thinking about that is because
39:11
let's say right now i talk about everyone the negative heavy sentiment blah blah blah who is there to
39:16
attract capital to gamestop that's what i mean that's why the stock price is in the gutter the terminal value of zero you need someone to
39:22
you need someone to tell that story someone to tell that narrative you know what i mean and i think on wednesday on the stream i was
39:27
talking about like what are they waiting for now right they they're on the right path they seem like they're on their path i've been saying that over and over
39:32
again but now it's august i definitely said this on the last stream now it's august right it's almost september and we still don't have that we don't
39:39
have that much of a story like what's the plan and um i just i expected more i i
39:44
i expected more come august come september with the consoles coming in just a couple of months you know what i mean so
39:51
that's not to say they don't they don't have one or that it's it's going to be maybe they're waiting for certain things to to unfold blah blah blah there could
39:56
be very good reasons i'm just saying i'm just kind of surprised just like i'm surprised where the stock price was in august 2020. but this guy gets involved
40:04
in talk about uh his ability to attract capital the success with chewie his background he clearly he clearly knows what the
40:10
hell is going on here with e-commerce uh considering it was considering what we're reading here right
40:15
and uh just imagine if they're able to attract capital to pursue these new potential revenue streams then forg then forget about this [ __ ] right
40:22
that's what i mean but this guy could he could really help with the narrative more so than anyone else involved at
40:28
this point that's what i'd say even the management i don't know the new management team has been doing much better people see still
40:34
keep conflating these management teams they think that gamestops past failures are a result of
40:39
the current management's which that's just bad analysis right but um still not many people know about the
40:45
management teams individually but a lot seems like a lot of people know about this guy and sometimes you just need one person
40:50
to get that get that story going pitch pitch the story here like like ryan he'd probably say a lot
40:56
of the same stuff that's already been said in a lot of i mean my videos but so many other people right that already said it well before me
41:01
but then he spins it into this legit this is what we can do with this and then sometimes who it's coming from
41:07
matters you know what i mean then people like holy [ __ ] this guy's got it um so uh attract capital on the
41:14
secondary market right the stock price starts rising but then even on the primary market can you imagine if they started raising capital to pursue i
41:20
don't know if that's necessary i don't think that's that's i don't think it's necessary but if you can raise capital at a good
41:25
prices you should right um so all right anyway that was good that got me thinking that line right
41:31
there that was good still lots of penetration and growth to be had just within the us market and it's continuing to expand internationally
41:37
cohen said this when he stepped away in 2018
41:42
all right sick okay keep going business wire this is just going to be
41:48
uh this is just their press release right absolutely chewy uh company petsmart
41:54
okay here we go michael massey we're excited to team up with chewie okay that's petsmart okay chewie will operate largely as
41:59
independent uh would they say i am looking forward to working with michael on the petsmart team said ryan cohen co-founder ceo our company is okay i didn't realize
42:05
he was ceo um i'm looking forward to working with my uh companies have shared a mission centered on a love of pets and serving
42:12
with pet lovers which will be the foundation for everything we do together chewie will continue to our customers with
42:18
personalized customer service customer service important in in like okay i talk about the 60
42:24
million power-up rewards members right there's legitimate loyal there's some loyalty there right i um like those
42:30
are important customers of gamestop and their employees too important employees of the firm too like these are valuable
42:36
i mean the employees themselves are valuable assets these they uh many of them really care about gaming and so forth they're experts on a lot of
42:42
things they can they can truly help customers and the customers would be going there they're looking for gaming
42:48
expertise and stuff i know other brick and mortar stores other stores sell gaming stuff but like gamestop is the major brick and mortar
42:53
retailer dedicated to it and um so you got the employees themselves who might even be
42:58
loyal to the firm but then the customers you got 60 million they're not all active right but even you start giving like um
43:04
they're doing that right giving them discounted coupons and stuff like that but are there other ways to re-engage them or make them
43:09
give them personalized customer service i don't know i'm just i'm just i'm just riffing on this article you know what i mean i have no idea
43:16
but um clearly what we're picking up on is customer service has been a key part of chewie chewie's past success um in speedy
43:23
delivery of their pet's favorite food and supplies but um which you think like i said that's common it's not it's it's a
43:29
that's business that's business stuff right um as previously does petsmart finance the
43:34
transaction all right so nothing else keep going that's it here we go this is the 2021 ryan cohen
43:41
started a company this is it okay that took on amazon and sold it for three now he's thinking about what's next
43:46
sick look at that photo huh pretty nice photo look at that
43:52
background um when ryan cohen was launching online pet routine chewie spent okay this that we gotta read this [ __ ]
43:58
this would be this would be our last one i'll check i'm gonna i'll watch this stuff uh later um these videos and stuff
44:04
oh there's gonna be a ton here all right i can only spend so much time reading articles on the stream i apologize but
44:09
um hyper relevant research right let's just do this one
44:16
spent a lot of time thinking about how to compete against amazon right now a decade later he's thinking about the he's still
44:22
thinking about the best way to beat him it's harder now he says but still possible and the best idea to bet on could be the one everyone says can't possibly succeed
44:30
that's gamestop [Laughter] whenever there's a lot of skepticism it usually means there's a lot of white
44:36
space in the case of chewy there was white space because no one wanted to invest in someone going head-to-head against amazon
44:41
okay now in gamestop's case it's not just amazon right there's um just the digital downloads themselves
44:47
but um all right since exiting chewie in spring 2018 corn has been taking his time figuring
44:53
out he wants to do post chewy [ __ ] is this is this what he's doing post chewie i know it's the first rc ventures filing
44:59
but has he is he not doing anything else right now oh [ __ ] i'm sorry i need to pause this i just assumed he
45:05
he looks like he's really trying to do something um
45:11
ah what do i search
45:21
apple mulch oh wait that was in the wikipedia that don't count
45:29
following the sale of chewie cohen made a significant investments into two companies apples and well fargo his apple investment
45:34
has made him the largest individual shareholder tech companies wow sick jesus nice investment dude when was that
45:41
crushing it but that that's not the same thing as what we're getting in this article is there anything else [ __ ]
45:52
oh we did it in 2020 all right so i'm not gonna read all these don't worry i promise i'm not gonna read all these but
45:58
uh oh is that the same article oh this he talks up okay so we gotta read that one
46:03
this is where he talks about his apple and wells fargo investments
46:09
oh is this about him is this his article
46:14
oh [ __ ] oh there's some good article oh see this is great stuff
46:20
this is great stuff that he wrote this that's i mean this is entrepreneur.com
46:26
everything i know from monthly to i learned by following the footsteps of my late father ted cohen all right so i'll read this later watch
46:33
your expenses discipline capital locations one of the most important skills running a successful business at chewie made a maniacal discipline
46:39
when it came to how we spent money delight your customers customer service you're just talking about that
46:46
we started chewing 2011 selling food pit selling pet food online wasn't a novel idea yeah okay focus be the person other people's
46:52
want to follow was fortunate take the long view
46:58
he had no interest in material possessions each year through thick and thin he invested his savings into the stock market
47:08
as we scaled chewy many advises to slow down and raise prices we deserve trust yourself all right okay okay okay
47:13
cool cool cool toss much of a 3.3 into apple and wells
47:18
fargo is this it is gamestop the next one oh is gamestop in the same discussion
47:24
as apple and wells fargo what what is happening up down is up up is down
47:33
the move goes against the one cardinal rule investing diversification so this is the thing about diversification uh
47:39
um and you've heard maybe you've heard people talk about this right if you're trying to make a lot of money diversification isn't the way to go
47:45
right diversification is the way if you want to like keep keep a lot of the money you make right but really if you're trying to you're trying to make a ton of money
47:51
concentration is the way that you do that and i mean clearly he did this with chewie but this the same goes for portfolio
47:56
management right uh you get it it's it's much riskier in theory because of that i mean if you're a value investor like
48:02
like people describe games have been super super risky and i i strongly disagree with that it's risky don't make don't don't don't get me
48:09
wrong but uh i think it's way less risky than people think and that's because i feel the downside's protected by its cash flows
48:14
and so you can be concentrated you can have high you can have highly concentrated portfolios with just a couple of stocks
48:20
like this and and uh and and crush it and uh in this case he's just being
48:25
he's just being smart with this money i suppose apple and wells fargo we don't know how much you put into it but even still i'm sorry
48:31
that's a tangent that's not relevant to this discussion yeah cohen felt strong enough and destroyed it it's too hard to find at
48:37
least for me what i consider great ideas he told when i find things i have a lot of conviction and i go all in cool
48:45
now all in he's a billionaire right his position in game stop is um
48:51
five times five twenty five thirty million dollars it's not a huge investment just to be you know let's just say that at the
48:56
forefront here right um he's not piling a billion billion
49:03
nevertheless this is what i mean though he's he's talking up the importance of what his next move is going to be um maybe he cares we talk about in the
49:10
stream sometimes you just need a management team or even some investors who care and that will really change
49:16
how i view the company in the stock itself because so many teams out here and so many stocks out there management team don't give it they're not really
49:21
trying they're just paying themselves and they're not really trying to do anything you know what i mean but so i i pay
49:27
attention to that stuff tree founder also buck tradition by not establishing a so-called family office first trades
49:33
oh but now he such private firms have served us the go-to methods for a wealthy individual
49:39
oh so look at he's really um [ __ ] okay cohen is sticking to his guns
49:45
and riding on his portfolio's rough patch telling bloomberg i don't want to swing for a single yet the 34 year old billionaire
49:51
emphasizes that his strategy is not for the faint of heart you need to have temper yeah was that it oh [ __ ] okay let's get back to the other
49:57
one
50:02
okay it's hard an episode whenever it would cost us to go to the other one since exiting
50:09
figuring out what he wants to do post chewie we know he's making a couple of investments in apple and um
50:14
he has a checklist of questions a startup direct-to-consumer brand needs to be able to is he looking for that's what i mean when i see this from a guy like this i
50:21
think he's looking for the next startup firm that he wants to invest in and make it big that's usually how this goes
50:26
right you go from one big startup to the next big startup usually don't see them go this is why it's big news right because usually you
50:32
don't see them going into what many consider a dying brick and mortar retailer to it's effectively becomes a turnaround you
50:37
know what i mean usually they're in the next maybe he's that's what i mean this it's such a small investment for him it might just be just a small thing
50:43
that he's working on it's not the thing um he's also been thinking a lot about the valuable
50:48
business lessons he learned from as far as yep we just read this just saw that article um back then cohen used the 97 bezos
50:55
letter to amazon charles as a roadmap for how to grow chewy uh comments about the need to scale
51:00
achieve market leadership and to make bold bets we knew we needed to be number one or that we would fail he said
51:06
if we were number two yep okay chewie played by amazon's rule for
51:12
supply chain logistics and the convenience of shopping online but added its differentiator the old-fashioned customer service of a neighborhood pet
51:18
store for its winning strategy at the end of the day we're really connecting with customers and people are emotional beings cohen said
51:25
chewie's handwritten holiday cards pet portraits right that customer service and petsmart bachui was the largest
51:30
acquisition yep since leaving chewycone has been looking on investments both public and private
51:36
but hasn't yet seen or come up with an idea as good as chewy sometimes the best strategy is just to
51:41
be patient and wait for that oh this guy is this is your value investor but he shared these thoughts about
51:47
how a new e-commerce idea might help compete how a new e-commerce idea might help compete in amazon world amazon
51:53
has chinks in its armor oh is this more about amazon this article its user interface is dated that's true
51:59
about amazon amazon's user interface uh it's kind of swag don't you think i'm not that i don't know
52:07
um with the flood of third-party merchandise and sponsored as pushing aside organic search results there are those are weaknesses a
52:13
competitor can exploit advertising plan for okay sell something the customer connects with emotionally
52:19
gaming that's what comes with my my alright let's keep going tui genius was connecting with pet owners on their
52:24
level mirroring their obsessive devotion to their pets and recognizing they were pet parents not owners yep
52:30
cohen was an obsessed pet parent when he started chewie he saw how customers were responding to online shoe seller zappos
52:36
and thought and i thought wow if customers can go bananas for shoes online imagine if we could do it for pet customers
52:41
who are as fanatical and obsessed with their pets like i am emotion is great but you also need existing demand gaming
52:48
an emotional connection a differentiated niche isn't enough unless there is existing demand right
52:54
that's right that's what i mean so that's like um that's the thing being the major
53:00
i'm gonna keep trying to back the game stop i have to that's the whole point of doing this right um gaming striving gaming is thriving
53:06
there's the there's the whole um the physical disc and blah blah blah just the tired argument which is
53:11
legitimate but i just heard we've heard it so much but um with gaming itself and being the only um
53:17
brick and mortar retailer dedicated to it and they also i keep on saying brick and mortar results they have an online presence i i don't i
53:23
being the only can i just say the only major retailer dedicated to gaming i should frame it like that but their
53:28
brick and mortar space which is what could come in handy because they have all these experience and stuff but anyway the demand isn't waning it's not
53:34
like uh people don't want gaming products generally uh maybe physical products that specific demand
53:40
is declining but that in theory could be replaced by a new type of gaming product or gaming experience this
53:45
is what i this is what people seem to be missing uh or many people seem to be not enough people are talking about i should say
53:51
like it could be replaced by a new type of gaming thing and and um i think people would uh would
53:57
flock to a retailer dedicated to that online and in store um and uh yeah anyway okay there's a lot of
54:04
startups where they're differentiated but they're not really existing demand right sure you want to direct to consumer
54:09
relationship but does the consumer want one with you but everyone is trying to build direct to consumer brands because it's easy to
54:16
do and because the barriers to entry are such that anyone can create a widget and sell direct to a consumer but i think you need to be really mindful of whether or not it makes sense
54:22
for the consumer or whether you should sell on amazon or for pet products or chewy because it's the most convenient for the
54:28
customer everyone wants to have a direct consumer relationship but does it yeah um cohen's also been thinking about how
54:34
the life in business lessons from his father we just read that article um
54:42
teleport remember his father had a heavy influence on his decisions he knew our financials okay be involved
54:48
in every aspect of the business empathy we just saw this in the other article too
54:57
tell the customer the pro sell the customer the product that will make them the happiest cohen's father frequently used the
55:02
example of two trucks of merchandise arriving at a warehouse one truck will make you more money but the other will make the customer happier
55:08
the answer he said is always pick the truck that will make the customer happier cohen said his father was never one to
55:13
relax and he always needed to be out
55:19
and he said uh and he always need to be doing something to feel a sense of accomplishment cohen says he is the same way and right now he's trying to figure
55:25
out what the next something will be for him this was january 2020 okay i look at almost everything that comes
55:30
to me but i say no to 99.9 percent of it that was true at chewie two ninety nine point nine percent these are his words and it
55:36
could be hyperbole but he says no to ninety nine point nine percent and he said yes the game stopped
55:43
against all the haters holy toe ah [ __ ] cheers
55:51
as a warren buffett says wait did he quote warren buffet as warren buffett says the difference between successful and really successful people is really
55:57
successful people say no all the time right buffett does he says that all the time but if you're a startup entrepreneur ryan cohen asks what
56:03
wants some advice on how to go up against amazon you probably should say yes okay so he probably does mostly mean
56:10
that he's um looking for the next major startup idea and saying no to everything but nevertheless you see saying no to all this [ __ ] and
56:16
he he knows his [ __ ] and he's saying yes to gamestop that's the takeaway right so we just needed a little bit of a better
56:21
feel for his background and stuff just um so we know what we're up not up against but what we're dealing
56:28
with here like is this as as potentially meaningful as i think it could be uh i'll re i'll i'm going to
56:34
watch all these later see when i when i'm when i'm dialed into a position i watch and i read everything that i possibly can but i just can't do
56:40
it now what are we we're an hour in we spent an hour on this [ __ ] oh geez i hope you care about gamestop
56:47
oh [ __ ] play the vids i don't care derek
56:54
i know was it was only two was there two of us i don't even know of con car view is that all is that all but the two is it the two of us in here is there a third are there
57:01
three people in here i don't know we're having a party you know friday that party let's do it
57:07
hey let me know can you hear this if i do play one it seems like we could watch one right which one should we watch yahoo cnb let's do cnbc i guess
57:14
that's the one can you hear that oh [ __ ] you might not
57:21
be able to hear because it's not going on the microphone congratulations thank you thank you i'm glad to be here so you're not a
57:26
shareholder in chewie no but i would imagine you have a lot of feelings about seeing this company that you built starting in 2011 go public
57:33
today it's a very very emotional day um uh it's humble not really
57:42
what i probably could do i think what i can do is i can oh you can oh i was oh because you're a little bit behind i
57:48
blasted it hold on to capital light business and it requires very little to engender its growth
57:53
and so you know the company has gone from 200 million in sales in 2014 to 3.5 billion in sales in 2018
58:01
and it's burned through about 140 million bucks all of which has gone into investing in new customer
58:07
acquisition and future fulfillment centers and so it really is a function of how quickly you scale the company
58:13
but at any point we could you know ratcheted down the marketing spending bid and profitable but for us the strategy has really always
58:19
been about scale and market leadership and building a really big business and the governor of growth
58:25
has always been free cash flow and so we've always been very disciplined about that you yourself had a nice exit a couple
58:32
years ago got some free cash are you investing in ipos this year
58:37
not not any yet [Laughter] another question specifically about the
58:42
pet business omni channel is big right now blending physical and digital retail given what's
58:49
happening with premium brands and treating pets like people if you were doing that would you do it
58:55
in urban areas or would you do it kind of in the suburban strip malls where the petcos and pet smarts have been in a patch i
59:02
really think it's all about creating an experience for the customers and so if you're gonna you know invest in physical stores it
59:08
really needs to be focused on delivering an experience where people want to bring their pets into the store
59:13
and so i think it depends on the category but to the extent that retailers are focusing on creating
59:19
an amazing in-store experience and i think omni-channel strategy can make a lot of sense you sold for 3-3 and you got a 14
59:26
billion dollar market cap today did you not sell for enough or has there been enough growth since then to
59:32
validate today's market cap yeah i mean i i i think you know we were at the time we were running a dual track
59:37
process and it felt like a fair deal to us at the time it worked out really well for the team at truly it worked out really well for
59:44
the shareholders of chewy and i'm glad to see that it's working out well for for petsmart so i'm very happy i love the the story your
59:51
original idea was jewelry yes right and what switched you to pets and are you glad you didn't
59:56
go into online jewelry well yeah i mean we weren't very passionate about the space i was at a
1:00:01
neighborhood pet store one day with uh tyler my poodle and uh it was an amazing experience and so i had an
1:00:08
epiphany that if i could really recreate that experience but do it online and at scale
1:00:14
and um and you know you think about all the small things we've been doing since day one right the handwritten holiday
1:00:19
cards and the pet portraits and the flowers and it's really bringing a face to e-commerce and so we were able
1:00:26
to differentiate ourselves and build a really big business and the vision since the beginning is really to build
1:00:31
the largest pet retailer in the world and it's been it's been an incredible journey a lot of folks like to point to the
1:00:37
ill-fatedpets.com in the late 90s early aughts i mean that was the example out there
1:00:42
uh the biggest example out there i think when you're starting the company in 2011 why'd you still move forward with this model i'm contrarian and so i think that
1:00:49
that created really white space where you didn't have that many people going after the category and so it created a big
1:00:55
opportunity for us having said that it was a low margin business that required getting to scale
1:01:00
in order to make the economics work how much does fast delivery matter in
1:01:06
this category because you got heavy bags of pet food often people know when they're getting
1:01:11
close to the bottom of one and for chewy the subscription delivery has been important does it really need to be that
1:01:17
fast yeah i mean i personally think so i think within e-commerce today it's really table stakes to perfect that
1:01:22
flywheel of fast shipping being competitively priced and then having the selection and we really differentiated ourselves
1:01:29
by being the category experts and you know really bringing a face to e-commerce and really at the end of the
1:01:35
day we just happened to sell pep products frankly i think you know if you're in the business of delighting
1:01:40
your customers i think that you know you could you could be very successful and i think we would have been successful frankly in
1:01:45
any category talk about a little what you know about say my pets you probably know how much he eats per
1:01:52
day and thus when it's time to order more food when his next checkup is due is that is
1:01:57
that all wrapped up into various algorithms you have back home yeah absolutely but i think that you know we
1:02:03
try to create an experience that's really frictionless and so whether it's the one-page checkout or just all of those things we
1:02:09
don't want to inundate you we figure if we deliver an amazing experience you'll come back to us and then we go
1:02:15
and we do all of those small things that you know really create that wow experience and you tell your friends and
1:02:20
family like this is the best experience this is where i need to travel so it's not a shower of notifications and taps on the
1:02:26
shoulder exactly right you're looking for the consumer to touch back themselves totally exactly i want to go
1:02:32
back to the delivery piece of this for a minute because one of the things i found fascinating and reading about the history of the company is the fact that
1:02:37
you actually built out fulfillment centers so a lot of e-commerce companies actually outsourced to third-party logistics companies
1:02:44
it's been a big opportunity obviously for amazon xpo ups fedex etc why did you
1:02:49
go down that route and how does that set up the company for future scale it really is hard to scale
1:02:54
to you know the vision since day one was to build a multi-billion dollar business and so we weren't experts in fulfillment in the
1:03:00
beginning we're using a 3pl it wasn't scalable and so we had to become experts we had to make it our
1:03:06
core competency and we brought fulfillment in-house in early 2014
1:03:11
and we never looked back and today when you think about fulfillment of chewie it's you know world-class operations we've
1:03:17
got seven fulfillment centers what part of this business is sensitive to the economy do people i mean they're
1:03:24
not going to stop buying food for their pet but do they buy more expensive food or maybe more treats when the economy is good
1:03:30
and then scale back how does that work i think we've really have the tailwinds of just the shift from offline to online
1:03:36
and then you know the humanization of pets and you know the market moving up and average selling price moving up
1:03:42
and so you know if you look even during the great recession the industry grew and it's a 70 billion
1:03:47
dollar attempt today that's growing at you know roughly three to five percent i think the last thing people typically
1:03:53
are going to cut back on even during a recession is their pets and i think what's even more durable is really the consumable
1:03:59
part of the business which makes up a big chunk of chewy's revenue oh [ __ ]
1:04:05
that was oh can i play back that one that one part hold on one sec where was it right here i was almost
1:04:10
gonna fast forward is back towards operations at chewie what do you think about that yeah i mean i can't speak to exactly the
1:04:16
capital structure but what i always say is another question specifically about
1:04:22
the pet business omni channel is big right now blending physical and digital
1:04:28
retail given what's happening with premium brands and treating pets like people if you were
1:04:34
doing that would you do it in urban areas or would you do it kind of in the suburban strip malls where the petcos
1:04:40
and pet smarts have been in the past i really think it's all about creating an experience for the customers and so if
1:04:46
you're gonna you know invest in physical stores it really needs to be focused on delivering an experience where people
1:04:52
want to bring their pets into the store and so i think it depends on the category but to the extent that retailers are
1:04:58
focusing on creating an amazing in-store experience and i think omni-channel strategy can make a lot of sense there you go
1:05:04
there you go oh we guessed right on which video to watch huh that's it that's it i couldn't be any
1:05:11
more uh not optimistic i couldn't be any more bullish i could well i don't know your thoughts on this
1:05:16
that wasn't exactly what you wanted to hear it almost sounded like he was talking about gamestop holy [ __ ]
1:05:22
i know it's confirmation bias right it's i'm hearing what i want to hear right because i got a big position in gamestop
1:05:27
i like but even still even objectively we can say the in-store experience if you're going to invest in brick and mortar stores i
1:05:33
mean come on that's the same [ __ ] and um and i mean that's the history of chewie
1:05:38
right but to actually say this in the one damn video we pulled up to just learn a little bit more about this guy and we hear that
1:05:45
line um as opposed to just you know what i mean like we're trying to read articles and read press releases and stuff
1:05:51
but to just hear him come out and say what it is we're hoping he could contribute to gamestop boom boom um doesn't mean they're gonna
1:05:59
pull it off right this is the whole thing with gamestop nothing these videos we talk about and the heston permit uh get involved like
1:06:06
these are just it could work it doesn't say it's definitely gonna work but this seems to be a good addition to the
1:06:12
team of investors to um you know what i mean like i assume you'd agree with that derek um
1:06:18
that but nevertheless it doesn't mean they couldn't clash they still could but this as far as a new person jumping on
1:06:23
jumping on board and it's a look at i mean he's being interviewed by all these folks too he seems to have a good
1:06:28
reputation and plus he's a multi-billionaire so that always helps um people gonna listen people
1:06:34
gonna listen now and especially um that's why i'm super curious like he invested in apple and he invested in
1:06:40
wells fargo that that even was a headline is kind of funny right but they're following his publicly traded equity investments like
1:06:47
no offense to this guy who care you bought apple and you bought um wells fargo it doesn't seem to me that big of a deal but
1:06:53
that they care because he is he's hot [ __ ] people care about what he's doing um and he just he buys a couple of
1:06:58
stocks and he's got he's got a number of headlines written about him that's like holy [ __ ] he's got there he's got their attention props to you man
1:07:04
and because you're obviously watching this stream and uh but um but he keeps on saying how
1:07:10
he's looking for his next best thing he says not says no to 99.99 anything that's very important so it's important like
1:07:15
is this it's not the one right because he has so much capital um i'm doing the math right right five
1:07:20
dollars per share times six million he's got he's invested about 30 million which is a pittance
1:07:26
of his total net worth but we see no other filings for rc ventures i can't find anything else
1:07:31
and it's such a huge stake people going to be talking about this next week right i mean this is going to be is going to
1:07:37
plus with a short interest in everything um i don't think this guy can can change
1:07:44
the narrative by himself can he can he i don't know i don't think so
1:07:50
i don't think so but maybe what maybe his word holds so much more weight than management i hate to say that because it's kind of ridiculous that we would even be in a
1:07:56
position that that could be true here's a management team legit turning around the business right and then activist investors involved for years
1:08:03
managing has been here for 18 months preparing they refresh the board and everything like that how could you possibly
1:08:08
how could they listen to anyone else besides you but maybe dude i mean this type of market i don't know
1:08:13
um i don't even we don't we don't need to watch the other ones because that was
1:08:19
what i was looking for like that's that was exactly what i was not hoping to look for but like it just
1:08:24
pertains to what we were talking about so we're probably gonna hear a lot of the same stuff people talking about chewy and um
1:08:30
the brick and mortar stuff but he probably elaborates there's a whole bunch of them too so this is great
1:08:36
should we watch one more eric which one will we go for though finance how long are they oh 349 we can
1:08:42
do that we do that the online pet retailer chewie had a
1:08:47
pretty spectacular stock market debut but today the stock thank you for having me i know it's been a little over a year
1:08:54
since you've stepped down as ceo um the stock like i said at a great start it seems like some of that
1:08:59
enthusiasm is fading do you think wall street's not getting the chewy story right yeah i
1:09:04
mean i can't comment on the stock price but what i will say is this is a business that's gone from
1:09:10
200 million to three and a half billion in sales uh over the past five years it's burned
1:09:15
through roughly about 140 million dollars in free cash flow and it's continuing to grow and so we
1:09:20
have deferred profitability in the short term to maximize shareholder value over the long term how sustainable is that that model i
1:09:27
mean the company really could have been profitable many years ago had we really ratcheted down marketing spend and so
1:09:32
we've made an intentional decision to really invest in skill and market leadership and build a much larger business now in
1:09:39
the in the last earnings report we saw that chewy's growth rate was actually slashed in half year over year
1:09:44
some investors are worried that perhaps the company's already peaked as as the founder of this company
1:09:49
what's your thoughts on that yeah i mean i can i can't comment specifically on that what i will say is that it's a 70
1:09:54
billion dollar tam true is a three and a half billion dollar business and i think we've really sowed the seeds and created a foundation
1:10:01
that's very scalable and capable of uh being a much larger business it'll really be up to the
1:10:06
management team to decide how quickly they decide to scale but it's uh you know it's it's early
1:10:12
days in terms of its overall online penetration there's been some talk out there i know you've seen it
1:10:17
comparing chewy to to pets.com really the poster child of the tech bubble back in 2000. there
1:10:23
are some similarities not profitable yet holding off on profits as it tries to beef up volume
1:10:28
um other than that though is that a fair comparison do you think yeah i mean i think that that is an absolute crazy comparison i
1:10:36
think there's really nothing in common between those two businesses you look at pets.com that was a business
1:10:41
at the time it went public was doing 6 million in sales its product cost was 13 a million chewy
1:10:46
is doing about three and a half billion in sales and you know it's burned through roughly 140 million of free cash flow so
1:10:52
comparing a six million to three and a half billion dollar business one with strong underlying profitability
1:10:58
really is not a fair comparison it is a crowded space though how do you differentiate right i mean everybody's
1:11:03
out there looking for the best price it seems like lots of places amazon the least of which is able to offer
1:11:08
convenience as well yeah i would say that you know the strategy from the beginning is really replicating the experience i had in the
1:11:14
neighborhood pet store but doing it online and doing it at scale and so you know doing those small things like the handwritten holiday
1:11:20
cards and the flowers and the pet portraits really showing our customers we care about them we care about them we
1:11:26
care about their pets and we never want them to dream of shopping anywhere else for their pet products and so pet customers are fanatical
1:11:32
that's the ecosystem that we built that's really the foundation and the soul of the company and being focused on this category is a
1:11:39
huge differentiator against some of our other competitors you founded this company in 2011 at the age of 26. you
1:11:44
said you went to 100 different investors they all said no yeah thank goodness you stuck to it what's your number one
1:11:49
piece of advice for entrepreneurs watching this right now don't give up i mean i wasn't going to take no for an answer and so finally i found someone
1:11:56
that was willing to invest in me uh but i could have stopped after 20 or 30 and you know
1:12:01
re reworked my business plan or gone home but that really wasn't you know my mo i was determined to build the largest
1:12:07
pet retailer in the world and i wasn't going to stop until i found someone that was going to invest and so just keep on going you know eventually
1:12:13
you'll find someone this is great this is great all right that's i do this one was listed first i thought maybe he listed first for
1:12:20
i thought this one was more informative for our for our sake but uh [ __ ] that's it that's uh i think
1:12:26
it's just funny that uh i mean maybe i'd heard of this guy but not this not the uh
1:12:31
not the level that i do now just because i'm not really dealing with these types of companies right but now i hadn't heard of them that i didn't know that much about them and
1:12:37
now i'm like oh this is a perfect fit for gamestop right um uh much more so i didn't i
1:12:45
i did my best to to read about um it was a donald foss and donald foster didn't have anywhere near
1:12:51
the uh i think he's a bit older too so um just just
1:12:57
or his businesses were older so when you're a tech type person and recently uh and you're having
1:13:03
recent success i think people want you they want to have more interviews and asking you more questions and stuff like that so this guy's more front and center
1:13:09
and um but anyway this is like way this is just a huge pickup for gamestop and for
1:13:15
gamestop shareholders i think and was it was up after hours wasn't it
1:13:21
i mean who cares who cares if it's up after hours but uh um oh he's he's got to talk about that
1:13:28
people because nobody if he does get interviewed oh you know what i wanted to check oh i like to you see this video
1:13:34
the whole time he's talking they got the chart up take my ticket that's investing this is what people
1:13:40
think investing is
1:13:46
give me a break uh oh and the other thing that was in this too was uh they talked about the ipos revolve
1:13:51
revolves in the roaring key portfolio where was it where were they doing that
1:13:57
right here um yeah
1:14:02
it's since come i don't know so i wanted to see when this was what was this
1:14:12
that was oh it's june last year okay right after they were gone okay okay
1:14:19
yeah is this it this is it like it's a smaller small percentage of blah blah blah is this his next this is what i think we
1:14:26
can change it sounds it looks like this is it if i'm wrong about that let me know but it look this is it there's nothing else on this wikipedia
1:14:32
page there's no other filings um
1:14:38
look at all these articles too you know what i mean bloomberg here we go oh that's the bloomberg did i skip that article what happened what i didn't
1:14:45
mention bloomberg here we go this is a june 2020
1:14:50
june 2020. all that's going on in the world and bloomberg's i mean this is bloomberg
1:14:57
i don't know yeah it's bloomberg who cares ryan cohen sung virtually all of his new fortune in only two stocks
1:15:04
co-founded he plowed virtually all of it he declines a specific mountain just two stocks this is exactly the kind of thing when i
1:15:12
find things i have a lot of conviction i go all in he says he has no real estate beyond the florida home he lives in in
1:15:17
zero stakes in zero stakes in hedge funds private equity or vc funds whoa isn't that kind of rare i think
1:15:24
that's rare isn't like everyone like dabbling in this stuff he says he's never done a private investment deal
1:15:29
holy [ __ ] this is june 2020. this has got that's got to be weird
1:15:35
right i think that's weird we i don't mean weird in a negative way i know that that word has a negative connotation but like um i mean i'm a
1:15:41
weirdo right hey uh it's weird you don't see i think like um successful tech um tech entrepreneurs
1:15:48
you i just feel like they're involved with everything he says he's never done a private investment deal he's been driving the same car for years
1:15:54
and he's lived in the same house since 2013. he sounds like a value investor doesn't he talk about being contrarian talking about free cash flows he's
1:16:00
called warren buffett um seems seems like a bright guy i mean clearly
1:16:06
multi-billionaire started up the company from scratch i try to keep my life as simple as possible so i'm not really a family office person
1:16:12
he's referring to the private damn this is good right bloomberg 2020 asked him about it what he's going to do
1:16:18
he says referring to the private companies that the ultra wealthy often established to manage their investments in personal affairs that's bad news for wealth managers who generate hefty
1:16:24
profits selling products blah blah blah blah blah if cohen had known the financial advisor he almost certainly would have tried to
1:16:29
steer him well away from his all-in allocation toward a diversified portfolio it's down to underlying facts it's
1:16:35
bursting there's almost no evidence of skill in security election i hope that's not true look at this oh i
1:16:40
beg i beg to differ his research shows that 70 percent of the companies that make up the s p
1:16:45
will underperform the average oh geez okay then again if you do a perform you'll probably okay we'll get back to i think
1:16:54
what is this this is about come on back to cohen fortunately for cohen the value of his apple shares have jumped 120 over the same time period when did he
1:17:00
invest in them did they say oh here we go cohen's wealth may give him a more wiggle room but the
1:17:05
performance of wells fargo show when he amped up his position in the bank in the second quarter of 2017 the shares were trading at around oh
1:17:12
that hasn't worked out well cohen says his average cost base is 46
1:17:17
oh that's bad ain't it holy toledo for now
1:17:24
could bounce back but bummer today they're worth about 32 dollars dragged down by the sales scandal that
1:17:30
involved employees yeah unfortunately for calling the value was apple share so jump yeah i mean if he was in apple 2017
1:17:35
that's a that's a quadrillion market cap now right well we'll get to tesla right although i
1:17:42
think tesla might have been read today who gives a [ __ ] okay based on the price performance of those two stocks the total values portfolio would have
1:17:47
scarcely budged since he sold chewie cohen says his portfolio which uh okay okay
1:17:53
can we use the word conviction a lot conviction says it's something you learned from his father who ran a glass or wow his father
1:17:59
had a big impact on huh that's great we're in uh montreal he taught me how to block the noise from the masses
1:18:05
to how to block the noise from out how to have a point of view and have conviction and not waver
1:18:13
and went to job and taught him the principal uh his father was his mentor and close advisor while he's building chewie and taught him the principles of stock analysis which he took to heart
1:18:19
when selecting his stocks
1:18:26
his father died settling out bummer um he frequently quotes the fan of us warren buffett which may not be a surprise given that wells fargo or major
1:18:31
buffett holdings wow gamestop um i don't believe it's a buffett holding
1:18:37
correct me if i'm wrong but i don't think i don't think berkshire hathaway is an investor in gamestop
1:18:45
so that one's that one's not in the same um classification as these other two of course right um i'm not sure it's uh cohen says he
1:18:52
likes apple because his products command intense customer loyalty right absolutely and it's a tremendous
1:18:57
business model i'm not sure it's fully appreciated defending wells fargo is a greater test of his self-professed contrarian learnings that small share of his
1:19:03
holdings has been on apple's about 26 okay okay can you believe there's a whole article about his two picks you
1:19:09
know what i mean that's it's not crazy it's just it's crazy
1:19:14
declining comments on the banks 2018 scandals yeah cohen sees both companies consumer businesses okay cohen sees both companies as
1:19:22
consumer businesses a type of industry he understands from building chewy the online retailer is famous for such
1:19:27
over-the-top gestures wow saying the same stuff over again this is what happens with these types of um success stories right where they it's
1:19:34
the same because the the journalists or the interviewers they want to hear about it for their own piece because they know people
1:19:39
they're like ah people are curious about this then you start seeing the same the same things over and over again um
1:19:46
he likens his okay uh he likens his obsessive focus on building chewie to his approach to stalking i don't want to swing for a
1:19:51
single it's going for a 10 bagger
1:19:56
my um what's the upside for game stuff someone
1:20:02
was it derek someone asked what yeah what's that upside potential on a short squeeze or um forget the short squeeze i mean the
1:20:08
short squeeze that's the short squeeze so difficult to forecast but like for an actual business model change if
1:20:13
there was something really there and let's say this guy's got to go to there and they actually do become the go-to place for gaming experiences and people
1:20:20
want to buy their game say you know what i mean like there's a place people want to buy their stuff there right i'm not saying you
1:20:25
necessarily said on birthday cards or custom custom porches their pets but maybe i don't know custom portraits of your favorite gaming character or something i
1:20:32
did i'm trying to shoehorning in an analogy here but what i'm getting at is if it becomes like the go-to place
1:20:37
people want to shop there and you actually change it blah blah blah blah then it's ten beggar i mean it could be ten bag or could be way more than that
1:20:44
um because then you're dealing with a whole different animal you look at the legacy historical free cash flows as to
1:20:49
what the uh the product sales might get but then yeah it's a completely different analysis you need to analyze it in a whole different light
1:20:54
i actually wouldn't even have much confidence in my ability to uh to value it because i know so little about that
1:21:00
future path i i lean on the historical path to protect the downside but this future path it would be
1:21:05
difficult for someone like me to analyze and but it could be it could be um easy for
1:21:10
someone like him to illustrate or talk about or to cause people to envision it which is so important for a position for
1:21:17
a company like gamestop in its current position where it's just that sentiment is way not so heavily so um anyway he's he's looking for a big
1:21:24
win with gamestop i could envision him actually getting it um doesn't mean you necessarily well but you can envision
1:21:29
and it's possible he wanted to over recommend his investment approach to everyone neither would i right none of these things you see none
1:21:35
of this roaring kitty channel's recommendations right uh he wouldn't however recommend his uh you need to have the temperament to
1:21:41
block the noise well that's important sometimes it feels like a roller coaster you get you get in you get a nerd to the roller coaster
1:21:47
nature of it over time uh for most investors low cost index fund is more prudent that's true uh but cohen says he's committed to his stock
1:21:53
picks and has no regrets wow you're only talking about stock picks huh tony that he's talking more about stock picks is it
1:21:59
does this seem weird to anyone he's talking more about his stock picks like publicly like picking stocks as opposed to
1:22:04
the next startup you're going to invest in i feel like every time i see stuff like this it's like oh what's the next what's the
1:22:09
next startup you're going to invest in and he's almost talking like more of like a portfolio manager like yeah i'm just looking for the right thing
1:22:15
and i'm partly saying that yes because he took a position at gamestop but even still the whole the way this whole article's written it's not like what's the next startup when you're going for
1:22:22
that you're going to start up yourself or blah blah blah he's coming into his stock picks and that's where we get well maybe one the
1:22:27
execution of amazon is just phenomenal he says that chewie we couldn't have staked out a bigger competitor if we tried did cohen think about buying a stock i
1:22:33
should have i wish i did oh in amazon okay that's june so this is it
1:22:39
gamestop gamestop is the next one oh that's huge it's huge i think it's huge we'll see
1:22:48
oh damn i was adding this week too so that
1:22:54
worked out well i mean i've been saying it during the stream how it's been kind of getting ahead of me a little bit um i mean i've been adding for so long
1:23:01
you know what i mean but then i talked about how i was out in july but i was even still adding on this pickup here i um
1:23:08
i haven't added above five so i haven't did i no i didn't i might have what was it wednesday i think i added to
1:23:14
some um to some to some calls or something now everything's so damn expensive
1:23:19
but the equity still the equity still looks like us not for everybody this isn't a recommendation right but
1:23:24
as far as my assumptions go the equity even at five bucks or whatever the market cap is right now still looks like a steal
1:23:30
it's a difficult case to make more for the options these days time limit options and all that but the equity it seems like uh it seems cheap that's
1:23:37
why it's such a big position the roaring kitty portfolio but um all right damn anything else to think about here
1:23:43
no other filings or anything right you imagine something gets filed you can file to like eight o'clock or something
1:23:48
um damn he didn't say anything specific about gamestop in there that's too bad what was this part that was him oh this is sick
1:23:56
are there any articles out about it yet
1:24:03
no not yet there'll be there will be some how about twitter when people say it on twitter
1:24:11
but did i post the live stream i did right yeah
1:24:18
a lot of noise always a lot of noise
1:24:24
all right so people people chatting about it i'm just trying to see if um
1:24:35
there's more than this right two hours ago that was six two hours of 6 24.
1:24:40
all right so people chatting about it after our stuff no big no big um cvc
1:24:53
fintel hey oh i could just follow them i guess i don't know i'd rather just check i
1:25:00
want to check on my time you know what i mean
1:25:08
all right so no what i'm looking for is just the um i mean it's a friday night it's friday
1:25:15
night right who's gonna be who's still working friday night huh crazy people like us you know what i mean
1:25:20
um that's when you can get some good with some good work done but i was just checking to see if i like
1:25:26
one of the news what do you call them the the new sites uh we're talking about but you have to think that they're gonna talk about this next week you know what
1:25:31
i mean this art especially this article this is this is nuts
1:25:36
looking for his did he talk about the next big one next he didn't talk about it in this one but we saw that other article
1:25:44
nothing all right all right i mean lots of people talking about which is good it's um people talking about it you know
1:25:49
um but i'm gonna be more curious to see wow lots of people there's okay so now then
1:25:55
we just we just got it ahead of it who's the first one
1:26:00
who talked about it first let's see who wins who wins
1:26:13
i'm just curious now who's the first opposed wasn't fintel was it
1:26:20
okay this one trade on the wire just says 13d all right it looks like some bots any who's the boston fan tail okay
1:26:27
ho door hey ho door hold door hold door okay um
1:26:35
and then jared okay just curious all right keep your eyes peeled next
1:26:40
week next time we next time we have the live stream well we're halfway through the stream that's okay this was worth it because
1:26:47
do i keep bad uh oh [ __ ] i'm glad i added this week you
1:26:53
know like uh we'll see though i mean this could i'm talking it up but i don't mean like it's gonna pop on monday it's not like
1:26:58
that i'm talking more about um i'm thinking about that narrative shift you know what i mean and i think
1:27:04
this has the potential to get that conversation started and then just imagine if um if i don't want to say if they
1:27:12
beat on earnings but if it's a good earnings release they know it's like a sell lease back and just forget it if they announced share or purchases i don't think that they
1:27:18
will but if they don't share purchases and then they come up with an actual plan and it's like really bullish and people like holy [ __ ]
1:27:24
um talk about a a a consequential two-week period i forget about it i don't even know what to say
1:27:30
um but so next week will be like at this point it's big it's safe to say there's probably not going to be any
1:27:36
news releases before earnings um like i think that now it seems like they're going to dump
1:27:41
everything like the sale lease back um i mean that's the that's a big item as far as we know but
1:27:48
like a strategy around the consoles are we gonna get something more something more palpable you'd think um
1:27:55
also isn't that to say i think that that is the day they're gonna announce the pre-orders or establish the pre-orders or talk about the price when do we get
1:28:00
the price for the consoles you know that's got to be soon right um jeez it's almost september i could have sworn that stuff gets released in
1:28:06
august but um so maybe they're trying to time it right so it could be
1:28:11
it could be i've been talking about a busy couple of months but hell it could be a busy couple of weeks but you don't bet on something like that you just talk
1:28:16
about more that longer term narrative shift you hope for that though [ __ ] maybe
1:28:22
we'll get a big article about this um oh wow
1:28:28
someone's gonna write about this i mean it's easy for it's low-hanging
1:28:33
fruit to [ __ ] on me and to [ __ ] on heston permanent and maybe even michael burrie apparently i can't believe people
1:28:39
i mean i mean i just mean like people on social media and stuff and like oh barry's crazier so you even see some articles out there but like let's see
1:28:45
someone [ __ ] on this guy ryan cohn you know what i mean like i'd like to see i just want to see what that looks like like what are you going to say to this guy
1:28:51
uh you think he doesn't know you think you know ecommerce better than him or romney channel experiences and all that stuff like you're literally interviewing
1:28:57
him and asking about his stock picks and then he makes the pick in a stock that y'all [ __ ] that everyone shits on right
1:29:02
then it's like it's harder to critique it's hard to critique stuff like that so i'll be super curious um
1:29:08
when we get that article i think we will i think we will maybe he even talks about it too maybe he wants he wants to be interviewed on it or
1:29:14
maybe he's still building this position and he's going to be hush-hush for a bit maybe he wanted to get in before earnings there's so many different
1:29:19
narratives so you don't want to go down that path you drive yourself crazy um [ __ ] okay now what 8 30.
1:29:27
i'm gonna need another i think we're gonna need another beer in the stream you know damn
1:29:33
how's the chart looking tell me that don't look uh semi-bullish huh looks looks bullish it broke 550 today
1:29:38
right first time it broke no oh yeah it got above there last week that's right oh yeah how much did he buy on last friday
1:29:46
what was the date last friday august 21st
1:29:56
not not much remember the numbers like went up like
1:30:01
suddenly and like rapidly it went kind of high all right not that much wasn't him he he contributed to it but uh
1:30:08
plus the timing of the purchases if he did it in one big huge chunk but uh who cares oh wow
1:30:20
i mean we know he was now i'm trying to think about like do i how do i what do i posit do do you make any moves based on this i
1:30:25
mean we already got the position right it's a big position um did i update i think i updated this
1:30:31
today all right we'll do we'll do this stuff next right um
1:30:37
it's it's 17 of the portfolio yeah that's updated that's updated i think it's 17 17
1:30:42
percent it would get it was going up you know um but now i'm like uh am i more bullish now i hate to
1:30:49
say that it's just one but but then i think all right so how it's it's sentiment wise this is undeniably positive uh for
1:30:56
effort actually changing the thesis or having a positive impact on the thesis what do we know about him we know that
1:31:02
he um um he interviews well and he says a lot of the right things we know he was
1:31:07
successful with chewie right but that that's just one company can he does it will it actually and he talked
1:31:13
about amazon a lot he says a lot of the right things said he's knowledgeable it doesn't mean he will necessarily succeed with gamestop but
1:31:19
as a game shareholder i like to see him but it doesn't mean it'll work out but you think it increases the chances oh i saw
1:31:26
so to talk about tesla right so let me just a little bit of a tangent here um which would tesla do today
1:31:33
down a little bit look at this look at this [ __ ] you believe this people people were showing this they still show is it oh what's the short
1:31:40
interest on this now there's still a heavy shot it would
1:31:48
okay okay short percent of float okay yeah for seven okay it was it used to be a big thing right people showing tesla uh but not
1:31:55
anymore um but uh what people were saying was um like questionable evaluation this whole
1:32:01
this whole time for years since this uh breakout 10 years ago not 10 years ago
1:32:07
this breakout this was a big breakout by the way i didn't i was too much of a noob back then to understand
1:32:12
big breakout right here boom oh man how much is that up i should be
1:32:17
able to do that in my head 40x damn
1:32:24
the me of today may the me of today would buy this you know picking up on the sentiment i don't know that i would hold this whole time uh
1:32:30
almost certainly would not have but this looks really bullish right that's what the books say but um there's been questions question
1:32:36
marks about uh tesla's viable long-term viability and so forth whether or not it can actually sustain what the free cash flow actually is and
1:32:42
all that stuff right but um but
1:32:47
musk does a really good job of selling himself selling tesla attracting capital we're talking about this guy ryan cohen
1:32:53
attracting capital you know what i mean like someone who can um just tell jesus fell off my chair there
1:32:59
someone who can tell the right story right to to get people to invest in you in you the person
1:33:05
elon must say what you want about a lot of stuff but like he does a good job with that he's attracted significant amounts of capital
1:33:11
despite all these question marks and then there's a case to be made that uh
1:33:16
um like you do it long enough now we're going on seven solid years eight years i mean i don't even i forget when tesla was
1:33:22
founded but you do it for so long that you you will it to happen that you attract so much
1:33:27
significant capital that even if it was just a story i'm not saying it was i don't have strong opinions on this but even it was
1:33:33
just a story you tell a really compelling story that was maybe a house of cards again i'm not saying that's the case here i
1:33:39
don't i don't care um but if that were the case but you tell such a compelling story and that you do successfully raise
1:33:44
so much cowboy price keeps going up blah blah blah that you can make it happen because you have all this capital and you can
1:33:50
actually make it happen maybe it doesn't end up being as as valuable as you were talking about it being
1:33:56
but you can envision that happening now it can also still collapse so you know like maybe there's not enough capital that you can attract to
1:34:01
to to prevent it from falling apart i'm just using the psy maybe tesla's the wrong song to use
1:34:07
because people think that i uh like making a prediction i'm not uh but um so where was i going with this
1:34:13
um it's about gamestop like um just the importance of uh talking to a
1:34:18
big game they talk the importance of narrative and so something like uh a tesla the narrative has been critical because
1:34:24
they don't have any free cash flow for so damn long so long that the story has been so critical
1:34:30
this whole time and um it must so far has has crushed that story
1:34:36
doesn't mean it's going to work out doesn't mean it's going to keep growing blah blah blah but this his ability to attract capital
1:34:42
has been hugely um important and so when you come to um uh uh how do they go
1:34:49
off in this tangent tugmo gamestop and just the ability to attract capital and interest and stuff like that
1:34:55
um um it's just it's super important and someone like orion cohen can can help with that maybe not to the degree that
1:35:01
uh elon musk can or something like that but that type of stuff is important and that's i i mentioned this in one of the videos or one of the streams like um
1:35:07
people were knocking heston permit for um they're like they're trying to trigger a short squeeze or something like that
1:35:13
they're just in it for the a quick a quick run up or something like that and that's like that's kind of ridiculous right because
1:35:19
they have a much they have a larger stake investment stake in game stuff than the management team george sherman has a pretty good sized
1:35:25
stake himself but that's still smaller than heston permit they've been invested for a long period of time this management team like they're as invested
1:35:31
in this as anybody they're yeah everyone's hoping i mean it would be nice to get a short squeeze but you don't know that they'd sell out
1:35:36
they're not necessarily trying to sell out right quick plus they're directors now right but um but if you can get it's a good
1:35:43
thing to get the stock price higher even if a short squeeze short squeeze accelerates that because a
1:35:48
rising stock price can help you attract capital you you need a compelling narrative of course that's like the foundation of it
1:35:54
here's what we're going to do long term but then like you got a gamestop stock looks like terrible right this is a it's a hard pitch to make when your
1:36:01
stock price looks like this because everyone looks this is what they see that for a lot of people this is the analysis they're doing and even the past year it's just
1:36:07
flat so you kind of need a tailwind here for the price to start rising and then if it's a short squeeze
1:36:12
then people are talking about you in a positive light and that in itself helps helps cr it helps you attract capital
1:36:19
and then if you i'm not saying that they're going to issue equity or anything like that but if you did raise capital maybe they issue debt and at a
1:36:24
really attractive rate look looking out two years from now i know they just did some high high yield debt but um
1:36:29
then you can take that debt and reshape and you can invest it and so it's uh uh so um i did now it was important for
1:36:36
so many damn reasons but that's one thing and a higher stock price would be helpful for that anyway um long-ass tangent on that one
1:36:42
let me close out of some [ __ ] or else i'm gonna keep talking chewy all day for better or worse
1:36:49
i'll keep that up for later yeah i'm gonna i'll probably watch this stuff on my phone
1:36:54
damn that's sick okay look at this chart god damn okay
1:37:04
anything else rc ventures close out of that uh you know what can we just start with
1:37:09
let's just start with insider buying before we get to the days it's just because we already did like that um
1:37:15
i you know it was funny i checked inside open insider first and then i went to the that's usually what i do finn tell a second
1:37:22
oh you know what i haven't been doing oh it just dawned on me right now like when we're looking at a company
1:37:27
ah i'm an idiot i have this shortcut oh i lost it why did i lose it
1:37:34
oh man oh i got to rebuild it these did i lose cause i must allow when
1:37:40
did i lose these what would i check this ah if i type in a ticker watch this
1:37:45
and i do this oh can i do it i got to redo it all sorry but i can type in the ticker once and then i click a button and it opens eight
1:37:52
different web pages for me and it opened whale wisdom open insider the activist scc site the chart and so you see me
1:37:59
typing in all this stuff but really i should be using my damn thing but it it cleared every all my saved bookmarks
1:38:04
and stuff disappeared bummer all right whatever i wasn't going to use right now but
1:38:09
um nothing today another avis thing we just
1:38:15
saw that the other day pacific ethanol that that thing's still
1:38:22
alive they do a reverse oh [ __ ]
1:38:28
damn this thing looked dead
1:38:34
ah this is bullish oh i missed it this is bullish
1:38:40
remember ethanol uh this is one of those ethan remember we looked at gpre regi um
1:38:48
rex rex um this one was so small i thought it was toast
1:38:56
what's corn doing
1:39:03
wait why is it going up
1:39:09
uh i mean it was priced in the gutter maybe it's just a business oh bummer what's the market cap on that
1:39:17
i've followed that for a while it seemed like a super speculative play wow that's not a bad market cap now ah [ __ ]
1:39:32
expands high quality alcohol production capacity all right i'll check that out later oh i
1:39:40
regret like so many times i like looked at that and um i didn't i never added it to my watch list i always thought as total look at
1:39:46
this chart see what i mean this one the chart can be deceptive um but i should have added it for it for ethanol reasons you know what i mean
1:39:52
just as like uh would the bonds get down to
1:39:59
plus the chart you know what i mean like i would have bought i would have bought i'm not afraid to buy on just this chart look at this um
1:40:05
artwork artwork i'm not afraid to buy on that this i
1:40:11
would about right around here is this weekly too and especially when it's holding up so it sells off then it bounces back up
1:40:17
sells off would have been nice if we were this is why it's so important to track because you might see it this time but you're
1:40:22
not sure i'm not going to do let's just pump the brakes we've talked about this on the stream right and then i say all right let's just wait let's just see what happens
1:40:28
let's see what happens and then it starts building a case of all right this is a new price level and if this is the new price level we can
1:40:33
dabble in here because this is super bullish then it takes off um i've done that before and it's successful for me it's
1:40:39
strictly technical analysis what we're talking about right here but then you have a fundamental story to go with it
1:40:45
and um i've seen a lot of success i've had a lot of success with it but it did the importance it's it's this
1:40:51
is why i think there's an edge in tracking i um because i don't think people feel like doing it it's it can be a lot of
1:40:56
work at times so that's why it's so important to streamline it which is my goal for the stream which i'm not that we're not there yet i keep
1:41:02
on saying that i uh but um what would be really helpful is these charts i
1:41:08
i want you should be able to see and i know you can do this with other stock
1:41:13
charting uh systems you should be able to see two or three charts right next to each other at the same time like it's kind of silly that with stock charts if i upload
1:41:19
a csv i can't see three charts i need to do one by one it slows down the process of of screening based on charts if you know
1:41:26
anyone in stock chart see if you can convince them to uh make a change i should reach out to him again
1:41:33
anyway let's keep uh well how much this wasn't a big buy was it 167 damn from the co-president the co-ceo oh
1:41:39
man anyone oh there's a couple of them oh [ __ ] oh is it too lo we might not be
1:41:46
too late like i just bought i've been buying prty because of clifford's house in there
1:41:52
kaiser sose but um it's annoying when you buy after a stock's already gone ten bagger you know what i mean
1:41:58
uh
1:42:05
over 10 bagger this is you know how difficult it would have been for you to buy right here would
1:42:11
have been so difficult and that and i remember i was i was saying this to myself and i i i still didn't buy enough of them
1:42:17
but you make the most money when you're you're step when everything's selling off right you
1:42:22
step into this crazy crazy uncertainty you're not going to have a lot of conviction i'm not saying you would have gone heavy into this but
1:42:27
and you just accept that a good chunk of them are gonna go bankrupt they're gonna it's okay and um and then you get you're
1:42:33
talking 10 and 15 baggers like it just so makes up for the bankrupt ones it's ridiculous and
1:42:38
and the way you sleep at night is by diversifying right um that's unless you really dialed into a company
1:42:44
like for something like this i don't know if i could ever have the conviction that i do because as far as i remember now now i gotta look it up
1:42:50
i have to look at watch wait till you see these fundamentals because it's gonna look um
1:42:59
another 10 bagger one i'm not going to call this a missed opportunity though because it really wasn't i'd followed it for years
1:43:06
because you know it like it went went from this is we went from 350
1:43:12
to 20 bucks in a short period of time and that caught my attention just a couple of months and then and i've been following it for
1:43:18
like the past five years and look at this you see what i mean you can unders at least you cannot you can sympathize or empathize
1:43:23
and ever since then that's when it caught my attention ever since then down a little bit of a blip down down down
1:43:30
down and i i in my mind i remember thinking like oh it's done it's done this looks awful there's no
1:43:35
way i can get involved unless things start to turn around and even right now it still may head south right but at least you see a change in the
1:43:41
trend oh this is the monthly chart too look at this uh the longer the time frame the more
1:43:46
meaningful the the signal you could have bought in at
1:43:51
uh 62 cents right there you know what i mean wow damn this is why you do the monthly charts too and
1:43:57
the weekly charts because i only want to do the weekly charts we'll get into a schedule with that
1:44:02
i was thinking we'd do it today but then that gamestop news happened look at this and even if you bought
1:44:09
right there you are but this is a one they're not all like this but you would have got a quick five bag or eight bagger whatever you
1:44:16
got in that i mean it's a change and this is what i think there's something to
1:44:22
technical analysis is that sometimes it's a it's a manifestation of um of changing fundamentals
1:44:27
underneath the surface i uh i don't even know we'd have to dig it if i dug in and i saw there is something
1:44:33
actually here changing like like we see with game step right there's clearly things that are unfolding um in the right way and if we dug in here
1:44:39
we thought if we saw this it's this is why it's good for sure i say i use technical analysis for screening
1:44:45
um for tracking just watching how much time do we look at charts here i mean during this stream it's ridiculous and
1:44:50
you know i'm a fundamental a deep value fundamental investor but i i it's it's it catches your
1:44:55
attention you just see something and it catches your attention then you go dig in and you're like oh [ __ ] the chart is telegraphing to me that
1:45:01
something positive is unfolding um and then we would have like maybe we wouldn't maybe we would have dug in and
1:45:06
being like ah it's not that compelling still i still might take a position though a small one
1:45:12
just because the chart looks so interesting but i wouldn't go heavy unless the fundamental
1:45:18
events were substantiating what you saw with the chart um that's why it's helpful to use both i
1:45:23
think it's the tracking that's like doing both and tracking everything that's tough
1:45:28
but boy yeah is it i got a little bit of a support here
1:45:34
look at this breaking breaking above this is the monthly too so this is meaningful breaking above four you might have
1:45:39
limited um downside going to the charts there's anyone talking about it
1:45:49
that was some good insider buying this in a big company 250 million or something 250 000. here you go plus 14 on insider
1:45:55
buying and what do you oh today oh is it up today
1:46:00
no nine percent that's not that bad
1:46:07
so they got 15 million oh how much have they been buying i see
1:46:12
a couple of uh
1:46:19
oh [ __ ] nathan gilbert has bought uh
1:46:24
almost a half a million kohler is only at 167 though
1:46:32
then an extra 40. and they haven't oh they bought in june too oh [ __ ]
1:46:37
oh and i bought it yeah okay two four six seven that's no joke but then
1:46:44
there was this big sale here at five how'd they do that at five did the price
1:46:49
ever reach five oh yeah oh look at that timely sale
1:46:56
that's a tad concerning see this christopher wright sold at five dollars sold a third of his steak
1:47:04
maybe he's just tired maybe he's out of the stock price going but you can't fault someone for selling
1:47:11
and they kind of they're kind of making up for it is there still who yeah anyone talking
1:47:16
about this hey carjacking conviction when did he get he got on august 13th
1:47:22
recognize that name
1:47:27
all right okay oh okay all right okay got something timely here oh a lot of comments on it
1:47:33
oh he wrote on august 12th too
1:47:41
oh nine dollar price oh i'm not going to get involved for a double double i was hoping
1:47:56
all right check out pex
1:48:02
chart insider buying um seeking alpha article
1:48:11
oh and who owns it
1:48:23
oh it brought me to the bottom i was waiting for it to load it was already there renaissance they own everything
1:48:32
no one who's greg who's craig engels
1:48:41
no one all right oh and let me just check the fundamentals real quick i don't want to
1:48:47
dig into it right now i kind of just want to oh i did it again see how many times i do this i ruined it yes
1:48:53
i got to remake this i'll remem like there's a whole bunch of stuff now this is good though like i
1:48:58
i built out a whole bunch of this stuff and i was trying to craft it for the stream and everything like that so um you could see things cleaner and um
1:49:05
but i didn't really like i said like when i said kicking off the stream on august 3rd or whatever it was i was really just
1:49:10
starting to get back into it again um and now i'm seeing some things that are broken or things that could be improved not huge things but like things
1:49:16
that just irk me as like when you keep on doing the same thing over and over again i'm like i gotta fix this let's check it out
1:49:27
oh they got real revenues though a billion holy hell that's way more than i would
1:49:32
have thought i like the market cap right 230 i mean i liked it more when it was
1:49:38
30 by market cow i just thought it was no bonds
1:49:48
[ __ ] oh this is this is just who is this guy this is another person that i might have
1:49:55
overlapping he's got nothing else here this is his only position from 2014
1:50:01
source date whatever oh i didn't mean to close that out
1:50:10
oh this that's because that's the only one okay uh fundamentals back to it the conditional formatting
1:50:15
has taken a while oh look at all that red ah my eyes ah
1:50:22
see what i see you know you see what i saw back then you know this is what i mean it's not a missed opportunity i don't feel that bad
1:50:28
it looked like [ __ ] although the billion dollar revenues though i did not remember that let me mention that
1:50:36
[ __ ] oh wow i was treading a big discount to
1:50:42
tangible book ah bummer but look at this look at it
1:50:49
look you can't even get ebitda positive you know what i mean what am i supposed to do with this i can't you don't even have positive ebitda you know what i mean you always
1:50:55
talk about like i need something i need something
1:51:01
to go off of you don't even can't even even can you give me operating cash flow nothing well maybe
1:51:06
oh this is quarterly sorry i told you i was going to do that
1:51:12
but i'm i'm lazy why did they change this oh
1:51:35
i can solve this easily i can solve this i can solve this easily because what i can do is um
1:51:42
it would take me like five minutes to solve because what i would do is i would say
1:51:47
i just add this teach thing what i'm just being lazy yeah watch this time me let's do it
1:51:56
what give me give me one one minute boom
1:52:06
this is at least this is for the ad hoc one this is the thing is because i got so many of these spreadsheets that i was
1:52:11
kind of like i'm like oh i can't do it for each one but i could at least go for the adhoc one and for number one
1:52:17
company report number one which is the ones the checkout when i check off things
1:52:24
the life of the individual investors you don't talk about this [ __ ] huh you think you think ryan cohen you think
1:52:30
ryan cohen has to be editing formulas in spreadsheets at 9 p.m on a friday nah not ryan cohen
1:52:37
kid we already did that one
1:52:43
i already did that one
1:53:00
did i do it on under a minute probably not that seemed a little bit longer 90 seconds sorry about that
1:53:18
all right it's still pretty bloody though
1:53:23
all right so what would we have put yourself in march you know what i mean you have that ugly ugly chart we had no bond prices
1:53:29
readily available i could have tried to look into it a little bit more yeah you traded on a fraction of
1:53:35
tangible book but you got some debt i would have checked out the balance sheet no earnings
1:53:41
at one point they had two years of earnings i mean it's just two years you had two years of earnings and that was during a very bullish year
1:53:47
for ethanol producers i believe they did have some operating cash flow
1:53:52
though [ __ ]
1:54:00
i definitely didn't even pull up the fundamentals that's what's frustrating there was too much going on too much going on i'm like i can't you
1:54:05
can't pull up the phone i also didn't have my check boxes uh check box this would have made my life so much easier
1:54:10
that's the thing when i was like uh the amount of work i was i was doing in march and april and stuff i'm
1:54:17
like this is what's most important this is what i need if to go through this i need it to be streamlined even more and of course it
1:54:22
could be even streamlined streamlined in order of magnitude more but even what i have right now would
1:54:28
have been so much more helpful back then because just to check this check this checkbox checkbox clear it out check
1:54:33
more check more then i got four of these for these um reports so i could do 40
1:54:38
companies simultaneously check check check check check and then go look them up and i didn't have this but i maybe i
1:54:45
would have checked up probably not though i feel like i wrote them off but look
1:54:50
revenues legit revenues a billion um operating cash flow
1:54:55
i don't know if it was positive through q1 this is through june 30th but positive two over the past three years
1:55:02
it's not free cash casual right that's not my point if you're when you're dealing in really dodgy companies like this forget your forget your clean free cash
1:55:10
flow discounted free cash flow analysis just forget that [ __ ] because you don't have that as an option and i say they say this so many times
1:55:16
and people just write it up you're like well i can't deal on this and i'm just like oh well that's where there's tremendous opportunity this is legit where you get 10 packers right here this
1:55:22
is where it happens you just need to accept some um
1:55:29
like volatility and risk and type you got to diversify in that regard unless you're super dialed in
1:55:34
this is what i mean i can only be i don't know how so i can understand why people have super concentrated portfolios because they can
1:55:39
only be super dialed in into a handful of companies at a time where you're tracking everything as an individual investor you can only be
1:55:47
i mean super dialed in like reading everything watching everything tracking every move um
1:55:53
i should even be better about tracking those the top 10 positions of the roaring kitty portfolio actually the reason i'm not is because
1:55:59
the ones that have the most upside tend to be some of the smaller positions that i'm i'm slowly building into it you know what i mean so that's why it's
1:56:06
i've been trying to cut back on the positions oh i get the cash position up by the way
1:56:11
five percent not bad cut it up five percent this week
1:56:22
eighteen percent on energy sixteen percent of materials yeah i i five percent okay i want to keep i think
1:56:28
i want to keep raising that cash just to touch or keep uh read or keep reallocating the capital we'll see
1:56:34
okay um so i just want to see if i saw anything else yeah let me add this too
1:56:44
positive cfo couple years anyway so yes what was i just like you just get a couple of these promising
1:56:51
characteristics they didn't have any open they didn't have any insider buying though you know what i mean like if they have the insider buying back then [ __ ] i probably would have bought
1:56:57
you know what i mean like i didn't have enough it's pretty cool yeah as i've gained more and more experience it's pretty clear
1:57:03
what i'm willing to dabble and what gets my attention what's a deal breaker what's not what's the tipping point if they had
1:57:10
insider buying that i almost certainly would have pulled up but they didn't right
1:57:18
okay i feel a little bit better and so then they didn't start buying
1:57:24
until um oh [ __ ] they had a little bit see how small this was so even they were buying
1:57:29
in june but look it was so small see what i mean why wasn't kohler why wasn't kohler buying
1:57:34
why what were they waiting for you know what i mean maybe they needed to be maybe they needed their company to prove
1:57:40
to them too that it's there's something here you know what i mean so i i'm not knocking them i'm just observing
1:57:45
what the hell took you so long um sometimes they legit can't make a transaction because it's like a blackout
1:57:50
period or they're in negotiations or something like that but i see they these look like so small these might have been um related to compensation
1:57:56
packages or something else like it's almost like were they open market purchases they
1:58:03
it says they're open market purchases but if we looked into them i don't care well you know what now i'm curious sorry i have to for educational reasons right
1:58:10
for educational reasons let's look at so one thousand dollars come on there's no way this is an open market purchase
1:58:19
there's no footnote what is this transactional you can if you google if
1:58:25
you're ever curious about these and you're looking up these like i i forget now but you can like google transaction code on forum four
1:58:30
and you can figure out what that p means let's do it right now give us a [ __ ]
1:58:45
look at this open market or private purchase of non-derivative alternative security well
1:58:52
[ __ ] oh i can't explain that that you know what i mean like who buys a thousand dollars like maybe
1:58:58
he has a personal reason for doing it like maybe sometimes it's they're buying it for um a family member buying it on a trust or
1:59:04
something but there's no footnote that's what's kind of weird there's no footnote they're just like he was just buying a grand
1:59:10
and uh it's kind of weird owner form that's direct d is direct i
1:59:17
know that a is acquired
1:59:22
how about the other one
1:59:38
what changed since then corn prices would change so let's think about what changed since june there may be business change right now it's
1:59:44
they're performing better we just saw a beat on seeking alpha or something didn't we
1:59:50
they were tossed 15 million is not that big we know there are 200 plus million market cap
1:59:56
um so what changed we know corn prices we just looked that up that's the only thing that changed recently but still
2:00:02
that's their input cost is it not what the hell do they do exactly
2:00:13
see they get grouped as like oil and gas refining and marketing which yeah i guess i guess but i don't produces in markets
2:00:22
low carbon renewable fuels and alcohol products in the united states the company operates in two segments
2:00:27
production and marketing producing markets ethanol and co-products yep yeah so usual stuff
2:00:32
right ethanol transportation is it just what's
2:00:38
unique about them relatives is there anything unique about them relative to the other ethanol producers
2:00:44
ah so similar similar somewhat similar
2:00:49
that's really coming down huh looked ugly remember that one
2:01:03
pull them back a little bit but this one is um
2:01:13
okay hey what's lumber doing ah we'll get to
2:01:19
this but just curious oh big down day
2:01:25
oh bro it opened but it opened above 800. okay all right
2:01:33
okay too bad they didn't buy in march bummer i probably would have took a small
2:01:38
position in them i mean you saw how many positions i had right i don't know there's nothing much that would have held me back on that
2:01:44
i didn't have any ethanol producers in the portfolio i don't think
2:01:52
and if coverage and convictions articles said he has like a price point like 20 bucks or a value of 20 bucks i might have dug into this more right
2:01:58
now but nine bucks
2:02:04
anything else look good in here
2:02:10
you know that would have been this would have been a good addition to the portfolio too because trade i mean a super discounted tangible book right
2:02:16
you're seeing this for so many for energy companies right but it's nice to let me buy some other deep discounted stocks trading well
2:02:22
below book well below revenues but that's not an energy you know what i mean
2:02:27
this is energy i guess but uh still it's a little bit of a different type of energy company
2:02:33
now it's above book value all right i guess that's about it but positive i'm seeing positive simple free cash flow
2:02:38
we'd have to pull up the financial statements but i don't you know what can we just do it real quick for um the balance sheet i don't
2:02:43
want to pull up the cash flow i i get it i guess if this looks super strong or something
2:02:56
current assets 131 total liabilities 286 long-term debt long-term debt 95. doesn't seem that bad
2:03:06
that's it any current debt oh current debt 96 okay so twice
2:03:17
all right so they've got some inventories cash it's all current it's oh it's so it's
2:03:22
all inventory oh they got some fixed assets right there i mean what they're actually using to um
2:03:30
to produce right that has real value for now that's the question right that
2:03:35
this is the risk with the industry is that if they're no longer if the industry is no longer subsidized which i
2:03:41
think it is now for the foreseeable future how much would people actually pay for these assets
2:03:55
um okay let's keep moving you know what i
2:04:00
think i might get them
2:04:07
what time is it nine i think i might go get another beer what do you think should i go get one more
2:04:13
kind of i'm kind of feeling like it you know like we're like just getting now it's nine right but like just getting started with the actual usual routine
2:04:22
oh dude oh sorry we started that's right we started with this oh i saw this he was buying more every
2:04:30
every every damn time huh
2:04:35
i skipped today okay now he's slowing down
2:04:41
24 25 26 27
2:04:46
okay just curious kind of popped back a little bit didn't
2:04:53
slowing down how about the weekly weekly is important here that looks because that's looking kind of rough
2:04:58
still looks bullish
2:05:07
i think when's that for hours send eight okay so that's at 560. okay close close let's keep going i saw
2:05:13
it was is this new gci yeah because we were just talking about are you talking about that on wednesday
2:05:19
starting to buy again trade date oh no no maybe we did talk about that on wednesday
2:05:27
no filed yesterday so we didn't i don't know about this
2:05:41
stupid i'll pull that up let's take a peek they get some strong key how about just newspapers newspapers doing okay in
2:05:47
this environment like plus they're super leveraged
2:05:52
all right i don't see much else kind of a quiet path it's kind of a summertime kind of quiet last couple weeks in august too people on vacation
2:06:00
um not many people paying attention or doing stuff i don't know what is volume volume's
2:06:06
usually lower i don't see anything
2:06:14
okay all right now let's get into this let's get into our daily
2:06:24
ah merging mark it's lying 40 huh not even sure what that is
2:06:30
i actually call it the i shares latin america 40. okay this is looking good oh why was this up
2:06:37
today can seeking alpha help help us with this too because that'd be sick they do they do etfs huh
2:06:45
look at uh honestly yeah nothing since um february but they might have one for brazil
2:06:52
that's a closely followed one all right so oh what were interest rates
2:06:57
doing today what were um bond prices doing let me see the uh
2:07:05
okay first the price of prices down 1.3 but let me see um this seven or ten year they eat this ztf
2:07:15
then yesterday 27th oh that was yesterday oh so it's a big drop
2:07:22
the bond etf which is an increase in the yields
2:07:27
okay let's pack this out they talk about pot oh because yesterday
2:07:33
was the day that powell actually had the uh john paul had that um the press
2:07:40
conference where he's talking about some people are saying it was a bit more hawkish than they were expecting talking about inflationary risks and how
2:07:46
they'd step in without hesitation and stuff and so people are like oh maybe inflation's a real thing i mean that's not enough to go off of
2:07:52
but uh interesting how about the longer term
2:07:59
ones 20 plus [ __ ] look at that huh
2:08:08
you can expect these right the longer duration they're going to fall a bit more look at the rsi too so huge
2:08:14
run up at the beginning that year overbought look at that look at this action and right this is just
2:08:19
i think i've mentioned this like this is crazy action you sell it in the the us dollar too i think
2:08:26
up and then down this much like that's crazy action for this type of an etf
2:08:31
right in just a couple of weeks wow look how much that's up huh bond
2:08:38
bowls crushing it oh this is bearish huh definitely a
2:08:43
little bit bearish this is daily let's back it up
2:08:51
looks a little bit bearish it's almost like one of those uh head
2:08:57
and shoulder type things but like get inverted but but on its way but on its way uh
2:09:06
hmm okay all right something to keep an eye on i'm not totally convinced i mean i'm invested in all these
2:09:12
inflationary type assets right but i'm not totally convinced that it's actually coming
2:09:21
is that the month of that the weekly let's do monthly monthly you're not seeing much right
2:09:27
let's see it i mean you need uh you just step down next week or the week out in the next couple of weeks
2:09:32
people start taking that uh seriously yeah okay i heard some chat about that i'm glad we checked this and then this
2:09:38
is just the broad what bond market see it coming oh when was the oh early august right okay
2:09:45
kind of come down a little bit i mean we're talking for small moves here right um what else would we like to check
2:09:54
oh us dollar oh [ __ ] here you go oh [ __ ]
2:10:03
that looks bearish oh i haven't i feel like we haven't checked up on this in a couple of weeks huh oh this is
2:10:10
a monthly chart oh it's bearish
2:10:17
well i didn't realize it was baloch i gotta be i'm gonna be checking up closely huh i feel like we checked it maybe uh
2:10:28
i forget the first stream would have been this week so it was like kind of flatlining but
2:10:35
now it's like oh it's making a move huh it's making a move this is this is bullish for hard assets and
2:10:40
stuff right i mean it makes sense i think we this is when we talked about it when we talk about gold going up you want to know what gold you want to try to take and guess what
2:10:46
gold's doing just look what the us dollars doing so if you see us dollar doing this and you pop up gold watch those past
2:10:52
couple months boom boom boom right i mean it's um
2:11:00
but um it's kind of describing people's um risk appetite for paper assets to a
2:11:07
degree i mean is there a better paper asset than the us dollar you know what i mean who's a better lender out there
2:11:13
in the entire world you know this is why um oh derek that's on gold miners uh well
2:11:19
you know it's not anymore but uh top five one of
2:11:25
my top five positions one of the top five positions ron key portfolio is a gold miner um i um i would say
2:11:35
how could i thoughts on gold miners bo i have gold miners in the royal kitty portfolio right there's there's a handful of them
2:11:42
if you want to see i'll pull them up right now so you can at least see the names not recommendation right blah blah blah
2:11:50
so i got new gold that's the top one and then i got somebody gold which is sabanya stillwater which they
2:11:56
do have gold uh they do have um um gold mines but they have the palladium acids that was a big reason
2:12:01
it's a they have palladium once um but gold too and i feel like people forget that and i think it's if gold
2:12:08
takes off like it is it's going to be an even bigger beneficiary of it than uh than others i have more than that uh i am gold that
2:12:15
was when i i added i think someone recently just to build out that gold position yamana i was surprised how small that position
2:12:21
was i guess that's it um so um i am bullish on gold looking
2:12:26
out uh bullish on gold the gold miners looking out a bit here uh and you saw buffett but um
2:12:32
not paracold but um more on like a like a multi-year play kind of like what
2:12:37
i'm seeing with natural gas right now you've probably seen me talk up um natural gas a bit
2:12:43
with gold it's the same thing like it's we're in a what i consider a bullish uptrend here long-term
2:12:48
thinking so like i um everything this was the inflection point
2:12:53
and i did um i did a good job buying up a whole bunch of gold assets in fact i bought
2:12:58
i bought calls on barrick gold which is now a buffet holding right and uh and angligo that ended up going
2:13:05
like 40x 50x something crazy because it turned out i timed them really right but anyway these were like obviously
2:13:10
cheap abundantly cheap crazy cheap on a fundamental basis but also the chart was like all right and it was like a multi-year downtrend just like we're
2:13:17
seeing with natural gas right it was like five years they peaked in 2011 there was like five years of every
2:13:23
like you're stupid if you stupid if you own gold and i was like all right this could be the inflection point they got boom boom boom boom and then it came back down and then once
2:13:30
this happened this is like kind of from a chart no not on like looking at it from a technical analyst perspective i'm like all right this trend is kind of
2:13:35
taken home we didn't get close the miners never got quite as cheap as they did back in 2016 but they were still somewhat cheap
2:13:42
and then i got really bullish when it broke 1400 this is when it broke 1400 this year but the gold miners look really good
2:13:47
right here this was the time to buy gold miners that's that's what i would say to that's
2:13:53
this is why your question is a tough one because my thoughts on gold miners right now are i'm not buying any of them if that you know what if that's just trying to get
2:13:58
like what i might do i think i'm like super bullish on them that you should be add them to the portfolio no um
2:14:06
the time to buy them was right here i'm not i wasn't too dialed in right here i'm assuming that they could have been goodbyes but
2:14:12
really i'm not so sure um here they were it was a good time to buy that september october late 2018. it was like september
2:14:18
because barrick gold their their ceo was buying in september of 2018 i remember this because i remember
2:14:24
thinking oh man he's making a statement here and the miners were getting cheap again every once in a while it goes and flows
2:14:29
they'll they'll become cheap again talking like price to book priced earnings and stuff and um and then in the barrack ceo that guy he
2:14:37
just he times the [ __ ] really we looked it up he was buying in marches this year look it up and so that late 2018 was a good time to
2:14:44
buy and then you had one more opportunity in 2019 they like sold off crazy in like may of last
2:14:50
may of last year or something this was the time to buy like right here the miners themselves
2:14:55
this doesn't look that cheap but let me just do gdx just for a sec
2:15:01
oh jeez hey they sold a bit more off what about
2:15:06
the juniors yeah they just got right back they almost got right back to where they were
2:15:11
at 2018. that was what got my attention and then when it broke above 1400 then it's like all right now i'm [ __ ] on a technical standpoint too so if
2:15:18
if you're still if you're holding the uh i fell off gold so you keep holding the gold miners
2:15:24
until let it keep let that trend keep going let that trend keep going and um
2:15:31
and now and then there was another time to buy it was in march of this year i've said it a number of times on my videos
2:15:36
and stuff because i didn't get as i didn't get as aggressive as i should have it was monday morning
2:15:42
march 16th and um they were crazy cheap again you see this
2:15:47
this quick sell-off it got done but this is gold but let me just see gtxj watch this
2:15:54
oh i did it again sorry about that they got right back they got as cheap
2:16:00
this is gtxj they got as cheap as they've ever been and i saw it and i didn't get it was just so much going on and everyone i
2:16:06
feel like everyone should get a pass at this i couldn't keep up with everything this was 16 this was before
2:16:12
i mean a lot was moving already and that friday too thing was so crazy but then i couldn't catch up with stuff
2:16:17
this is the plight of the individual investment like i couldn't keep up and i'm like holy [ __ ] these prices and then they kind of bounce back that day
2:16:23
and then you see this is this daily this is weekly and then you see it bounce back that week but anyway this was the time this was the time i i
2:16:30
i was super bullish on the gold miners i just wasn't acting fast enough and now i'm in you're in a holding pat
2:16:35
you're in like a holding pattern of gold's super bullish right now but the miners don't look super cheap
2:16:41
i know people are talking about it because buffett bought barrack and everything like that but what what what i don't know what the
2:16:47
thesis is for buying them right now they don't look super cheap in a fund if the long term secular outlook you
2:16:53
look at five years i can understand that thesis but that's not how i that's not how i roll i that's not how i invest i invest on like
2:17:00
when things are cheap or the trend is in my favor blah blah blah you know you're getting a
2:17:05
better feel for for my style but right now my style there's nothing to be buying like i bought that i am
2:17:11
gold position just because i was kind of surprised how low my gold allocation was it should have been a bit higher
2:17:16
i've just been so diversified so now i'm in now i'm waiting i i think i mentioned on the gold
2:17:24
i'm all over the place on my typing don't don't drink and don't drink and chart you know what i mean
2:17:30
yeah now i'm kind of just waiting i'd like if i were going to add more to my gold i kind of do maybe a lot of people are
2:17:35
saying this too i need it to pull back even more i wanted to pull back in this rsi down to like 50 or something
2:17:41
i'm satisfied with my current allocation i do wish it were more but i'm not willing to overextend myself
2:17:46
and buy at these prices because i don't i um i don't know i mean we got the
2:17:52
election coming up too i'll tell you maybe i apologize i'm sure i feel like i did mention this on the stream but
2:17:58
when i bought those gold miner options back in 2015
2:18:03
yeah it was 2015. i bought them looking out um a year and a half so they weren't expiring in january 2016. they were expired january 2017
2:18:10
so at the time i was buying them just because gold miners were selling off and and um they just looked super cheap and everyone was it was august of 2015.
2:18:17
everyone it was great it was a crazy time and um and i had them they were up like 20x 40x i kind of forget what they were
2:18:23
but then i had them like going into the election so here we are four years later and i'm like you know what i better keep more money on the table because
2:18:29
this this election is kind of nuts and uh all the uncertainty going around and gold could go up crazy and um
2:18:39
and so this was what was this this was right around this time period like right here so they're starting to go up and i'm like you know what i think i'll keep
2:18:45
some money on the table here and as it turned out it was the wrong move what happened was
2:18:50
that night when um i think when when they said that trump had won the election gold skyrocketed five
2:18:56
percent and then the next day it collapsed then it went boom boom boom and i'm like oh i messed up and so there i was i had everything
2:19:02
right on the uh on my calls which was fundamentals focused and sentiment based like people were really
2:19:07
bearish on everything back in the day and then i'm like you know what maybe i'll just play the election here because this
2:19:13
turned out to be the wrong decision i felt so stupid after that so i won't do it this time which could watch it will work out watch
2:19:19
watch gold take off to the moon and i'll feel like oh i got it wrong but uh i won't do it again because that was
2:19:24
that's kind of against i kept i should i'm okay keeping somebody on the table i'm okay with some of my options expiring worthless that
2:19:30
that happens to me all the time but i kept too much on i should have um i should have trimmed even more i was
2:19:37
because i was thinking that i i was thinking at the time to say nothing this isn't i don't get into i don't want
2:19:43
to get into politics on this channel but i thought this is from an investment perspective not an investment perspective but an
2:19:48
odds perspective that the odds of trump winning were higher than what was being priced in by the
2:19:54
market by the polls and everything like that that's all i'm saying like that i
2:19:59
thought that it was the that just that the odds were higher that he stood a better chance than he was people were talking about
2:20:05
to say nothing about politics i'm not saying anything like that i'm just trying i'm trying to read the news and stuff like that i remember people like
2:20:11
completely writing it off and i'm like oh i think there's a higher chance than this of him
2:20:16
at least going the distance you know what i mean and with that in mind thinking that'd be a lot more uncertainty maybe things would be like
2:20:22
what's going on what if trump wins like i've never had a president like this before what's going on and so i kind of
2:20:27
read that right which is which is kind of cool but then i got but as it pertained to my
2:20:33
investments i had like backfired i'm like ah so that's the thing it's one thing to like make a accurate forecast some fundamental
2:20:39
forecasts but what matters is what the price action is this is why price matters and um and now here we are again with again
2:20:46
trump going um uh going for a re-election this time around and gold shooting up again but now
2:20:52
earlier but uh anyway my what i'm getting at is i don't know what the hell gold price is going to do over the next couple years i've heard the fundamental
2:20:57
arguments um but now i'd say i'm more just leaning on the fundamentals and technicals the sentiment seems a little bit
2:21:04
overbought you know what i mean and i don't like to buy at those times i will buy it those times but um i don't like
2:21:09
to and then now look check out the rsi on the daily this is getting kind of bearish
2:21:14
you know what i mean um how this is weekly too is this weekly ah this is looking kind of bearish you know what i
2:21:19
mean like so i don't so what what's the allocation
2:21:24
five percent
2:21:31
did i get over here
2:21:37
gold four point two percent i don't know i'm okay with that
2:21:46
it should be higher than that it should be like it should be like six percent or eight percent by virtue of it rising that's where i
2:21:53
messed up i messed up by not going heavier in march but that's because everything was cheap you know what i mean like um
2:22:02
like in like 2018 now that august september october 2018 that was the time to be loaded up on gold because not
2:22:08
it's not like there was a ton of stuff that was cheap and then the market sold off in late 2018. and then last year in may and june when
2:22:14
it pulled back that was the time to be adding because not everything was selling off but then everything sold off in march and i was like i said i was
2:22:19
slow moving but i was just more diversified and so i didn't see that as strong relatively speaking i wasn't as strongly
2:22:26
bullish i guess i'm you know what i mean what i do is is more important i say a lot of stuff but and i try to reflect
2:22:32
a little bit of introspection you know think about what you were thinking about and i guess um in that light
2:22:41
i don't know how much of the miner is that let's take yamana for example because
2:22:46
that's when i would have gone um what i mean like they're not up that much they're not up that much so then i
2:22:53
see something like this i think who gives this okay i didn't
2:22:58
they're not up that much
2:23:04
although i did no i did new gold pretty well i think my average cost basis is uh 75 cents on this one you know what i
2:23:10
mean so i was a little bit slow moving there and then what i was thinking too is like because i i think this strength this
2:23:16
importantly this i think this trend is still intact so i think this um this inflection point
2:23:22
here i think it's still intact for now um
2:23:28
this multi-year bull trend this is what i'm trying to save with natural gas i think might be happening with natural
2:23:33
gas and with that in mind i need i can't be i need to add on the pullback but i will
2:23:38
add in the pullback eventually we may reach a point and this is going to be what the question is is is this cycle over but i don't think
2:23:45
it is um
2:23:50
boom boom higher lows you know what i mean higher low the low higher low high or low higher low
2:23:58
you know what i mean boom boom boom boom boom it's it's a very it's very clean this seems very clean to me gold trades are
2:24:03
so does bitcoin they trade very clean to technical analysis this is why i'm glad i picked up the technical analysis
2:24:09
i still got a lot to learn right i'm not drawing lines all over the place i'm like
2:24:14
um but it seems like it's um
2:24:20
it seems like it's still intact so i don't know look at that they're only
2:24:26
doubles
2:24:34
yeah a play on gold miners right now or even gold is just a bet on that like the
2:24:40
dollar i mean the dollar does look bearish right
2:24:50
this is more like um this is like a it's an asset play it's like uh it's like um it's like a macro play
2:24:56
kinda
2:25:05
what if i do um oh let's do this hey got me curious
2:25:14
let me do oh let's do this industry filter let's do this right now circ okay watch this clear them out
2:25:22
clear them out clear them out it's hard to yell okay let me do gold
2:25:32
see i got i gave myself shortcuts because i've done this so many times like hey just give me let me check off gold check this out so this is kind of
2:25:37
cool and then i'll do this because i ain't scrolling boom okay so now we have all our gold miners
2:25:45
sorted by in this case by market cap oh this is sick i don't even think we've used this on the stream yet this is dope
2:25:52
uh so based strictly on the fundamentals first thing that sticks out to me is there ain't much conditional formatting
2:25:59
ebitda to ev um
2:26:04
0.8.4 all right so that's i mean those are those are kind of nice
2:26:20
seems like pretty pretty cheap on that but on that basis huh this is good too i i should have done
2:26:26
this the other day when i was trying to look up gold miners what was i doing yeah i should have just done this
2:26:33
see no gold lower on there well there's some other ones i have in here forgot about these those must be super speculative huh the
2:26:40
earnings yield all right so they cheap on an earnings yield what is it 10 oh seven percent seven point seven
2:26:45
percent trailing 12 month probably
2:26:57
look at the look at the percent of 52 week high they're all pretty close
2:27:03
oh they were up today was gold yeah gold was up a little bit today
2:27:13
you know what i'm kind of interested in doing is oh let me do this oh this is sick see that see this checkpoint i was gonna
2:27:19
go type in a whole bunch of tickers look at this this is great boom boom
2:27:27
we'll do yamala boom is that the right market cap for gold
2:27:33
fields it's not 11 billion is it
2:27:41
well that's way bigger than i realized oh i thought that was a smaller company
2:27:47
[ __ ] they merged it was a merger right
2:27:56
oh [ __ ] all right let's go check out these fundamentals what do you say what do you say
2:28:04
all right so just look we'll do use gold this barricade this is a we say buffett pick but it's berkshire
2:28:10
hathaway right could have been anyone safe hey how many times do you see this uh how many times do you see this safe over
2:28:16
here huh never never when i'm pulling up a company all
2:28:21
right so you're trading at the turn at 29 29 bucks that sounds right tangible book nine bucks but this is um
2:28:29
after years of write downs and so forth earning two bucks
2:28:38
and the expectation would be that um
2:28:48
that if um that this trend is taking hold that these increase are going to
2:28:53
persist for quite a bit you remember look back in the day here you can see they had pauses crushing it on the earnings front for years for for five
2:28:58
years it's taken a while to get back oh that's sorry that's not earnings um
2:29:04
two three four two thousand nine everything should get a pass but like every single year paul and then they've been dealing with losses and loss of losses and then
2:29:10
they're finally turning a profit here what's interesting too about gold miners but all miners right one of them well one of their
2:29:15
major costs are uh of of production energy prices and energy prices are in
2:29:21
the gutter they're really cheap right now so that's kind of um that's a it's a it's a boost earnings
2:29:28
yeah and then gold prices are rising and they've been for years cutting down their costs all right now you got me
2:29:34
thinking um right gold prices are right now rising to like all-time high do we get all-time
2:29:41
huh yeah we're all the time all right
2:29:46
silver i know we're not there but go we got them
2:29:51
yeah we got it yeah which time it was though um in this whole time they've been cutting costs cutting costs cutting costs this
2:29:58
is what i'm saying with natural gas too is cutting costs for years years on in years and they're still throwing off losses thrown off losses and what
2:30:03
happens is the cycle finally turns and sometimes in a big way
2:30:09
all right they issued this share intuitions because they merged with um gold court right is this them gold corp
2:30:15
oh is that newmont whatever we know was oh no it was our wrangled brain gold yeah new mont marsh with gold
2:30:21
corp um right so it's a different business model [ __ ] that's right now you're getting close to not a duopoly or
2:30:28
oligom it's not even all um oligopoly because it's a number of companies but the big ones the big ones
2:30:36
if they're increasing scale yeah you'd think that there might be some um
2:30:41
i hate to use this word but synergies right and i for you synergies for a gold mine is that a thing can you actually it seems
2:30:48
like i shouldn't be able to say that i don't know i need to read more about it i guess what are people saying i
2:30:55
uh i mean i get it it's more of a style play you know what
2:31:00
i mean like on what basis does this look like of all the companies you've seen us looking at during the stream and stuff
2:31:05
it doesn't look like what does it look super cheap based on earnings are one year of earnings but
2:31:11
that's the thing that that's historical earnings blah blah blah blah blah if future earnings are three dollars per share and four dollars per share
2:31:18
um then there's a case to be made that it's
2:31:24
cheap but even then for something like barrical than a double i um
2:31:29
so what if we get start getting into the smaller ones what about uh oh it's like the new mods man what nothing's cheap though so even
2:31:35
operating casual so forget earnings for just a second but operating casual has been a buck a buck 50. and simple free flow is obviously going
2:31:41
to be less these they're never great businesses right although berkshire's buying them
2:31:47
and then you look at net cash flows it's just not classically cheap you know what i mean that doesn't mean you can't dowel or anything like that
2:31:52
i'm just saying this is why it doesn't have my attention right now i need something
2:31:57
even rampant pessimism you know what i mean i said it's which is hard to um what's the word like
2:32:04
put it into a number like people always try to do with risk right it's hard to put it into a number but um you can just
2:32:10
feel it you can feel it in the marketplace and every once in a while i feel it and um
2:32:17
nowhere close to it right now because this is when this is super bullish so i don't have that going for it and i can't find anything i don't see anything here
2:32:24
yamana yvonne has never really looked that cheap trades that
2:32:29
tell you these are all going to be super cheap if gold starts coming like like feverish like a fever pitch
2:32:35
type thing which can happen right that can happen with many asset classes it could happen with bitcoin could have with gold
2:32:40
then these are going to trade at multiples of book value five times book value in which case these are all stupid cheap right
2:32:46
even i mean your mod is nowhere close to its previous high um and that was a let's see so the
2:32:51
previous high would have been like 2011 so maybe two times maybe it was at two times book um
2:33:00
just about two times book 2012 um of course but now book if book grows and so forth so that's the thing i could see a case
2:33:06
for i mean i got it five percent i got it four percent i got a five percent but i it's hard for me to add to add to
2:33:13
that right here at these levels and i get the thesis and stuff but i would need to read something read an analysis that's super compelling and a
2:33:19
lot of the stuff i see out there doesn't have is i don't find particularly convincing if you have anything i'd take a look but
2:33:25
if it's if it's just the usual case of like the us dollar collapsing which is a legitimate i'm not knocking that thesis
2:33:31
i just mean it's not it's hard for me to um bet a lot on something like that with
2:33:37
where these current prices are like i'll buy into that thesis when the stock price pulls back back down to here something like that so
2:33:44
we'll revisit this on a pullback which inevitably will come that doesn't mean that maybe it'll come
2:33:49
when it's stock price is much higher and stuff like that but uh rarely is something super super bullish for long periods of
2:33:55
time it happens so that happens
2:34:00
and again i'm bullish i'm this trend still looks intact to me i'm not saying i'm bearish on gold i'm not
2:34:09
good question this is a good thing for me to be thinking about too
2:34:22
and the only other thing i'd say is this is a big reason new gold is as big of a position as it is it really it makes no sense
2:34:27
it's borderline and defensible in one of my videos when i was doing one of those long ass spreadsheet videos on the channel
2:34:32
i um new gold was like the top position i'm like oh [ __ ] this is just that's what i need people
2:34:38
gonna do not that anyone's watching those videos but uh you'd see if you saw my top position shot with new gold you'd be like what the hell kind of portfolio
2:34:44
is this but part of that reason is because i was so bullish on gold i think i made those videos in like may or june and gold
2:34:50
new gold had just doubled smartly but um it's because my added kicker for if gold
2:34:57
does work out is i think new gold will be one of the biggest winners i think it could um did i check it off come on
2:35:10
where's new gold right here because they're also they're like it's a business turnaround
2:35:15
and um they're a gold miner just like the other ones with real gold uh assets
2:35:20
and the grail gold mines um and uh but they are suffering from like a business turnaround they had to
2:35:26
shut down mines and stuff like that and i just thought if gold prices take off
2:35:31
number one the value of their minds is going to go up quite a bit higher but also it increases the chances they'll be able to
2:35:36
successfully turn around and so the stock price it would need to be repriced in this new environment and i think that's quite a
2:35:42
bit higher but let's check out like maybe new gold's still cheap then at least i can i hope it's cheap because how am i going to defend my position if it's not i
2:35:49
would just say that part of part of the reason is uh i'm kind of making up for
2:35:54
what i consider is somewhat smaller like i said i thought it was gonna be six eight percent right now so i'm a smaller
2:35:59
goal position by having a riskier gold position as my top one see what this looks like please be cheap
2:36:05
please be cheap please be cheap
2:36:11
oh that was only through 2019 by the way that was yamana i see because these are canadian companies damn so i need an updated
2:36:18
balance sheet but uh so look at this so it trades at like one times book value which is something and maybe updated book value could be
2:36:23
higher but uh and then you look at what historical book value was which we could have done with yamana
2:36:28
yamada was like will we say what was yamana no historical value was
2:36:34
10. it trades at six right now so um it's not that much higher and there's stuff that's happened since then
2:36:40
i think they may have they just sold like a um say a royalty on their current mine so
2:36:46
it's not like the same business or anything like that but i'm just looking at the numbers just pointing stuff out that's all
2:36:51
and i see um after all these write downs and stuff there may have even been an asset sale in there but based on the
2:36:56
revenues maybe not oh they got their revenues back up so you can see like what the mines may have been historically value
2:37:02
but again there's more nuance to this i'm just putting stuff out um and then
2:37:07
not so much cheap on the ebitda basis right i mean you're talking um five times even though is anything lit
2:37:13
up oh the revenues is kind of lit up green but yeah one times tangible book and then the operating casual
2:37:18
39 cents um 161 also still not super cheap i mean i know
2:37:23
it's lit up green right here that's a 28 operating cash flow there's no simple free cash flow it's all negative this looks really bad doesn't it but
2:37:30
turning positive i guess that's my thought and is that um it doesn't it really doesn't look that
2:37:35
super compelling at all i'm happy it's worked out as happy it's worked out as well as it did i kind of just knew the story and
2:37:41
it was just a gold play it wasn't so much because i it was it was like making up for my
2:37:48
everything else is there anything else here that stands out not really
2:37:53
the book value i like and that's not even necessarily up to date let me just get this real quick
2:38:00
now i want to calculate i do want to calculate book value i haven't done it in a while
2:38:08
oh they sold the blackwater project
2:38:14
unless you sell for a 200 million
2:38:21
a gold stream on eight percent of gold producing though
2:38:30
oh [ __ ] i think i should know that huh i'm always just thinking it's the um
2:38:36
just the gold price that's driving action
2:38:42
oh yeah didn't we just see his article rough session for a new gold on the right track i don't know this person though
2:38:50
all right let's can we just check the uh let me just check the balance sheet the
2:38:56
time we get 9 40 [ __ ] [ __ ] we at least need to get through what happened today all right
2:39:02
let me just so now there's been a change though because now that cash balance has changed would the balance sheet look like as of june 30th let's check that oh this
2:39:09
looks familiar didn't we look this up i think we did i should maybe dig back into this no
2:39:16
right yeah rainy river is the big one where's that balance sheet
2:39:27
oh they separated out this is dumb some of the some of these companies do this i have to go over to financial and other
2:39:32
reports canadian companies
2:39:41
this excuse me this is ridiculous that i have to do this for um for some of the holdings in the uh
2:39:46
portfolio that i can't even just pull the balance sheet individual investor okay here we go just
2:39:52
check it's again against change but let's just see total equity 837 838 divided by
2:40:00
what is that is that all tangible i think it is
2:40:10
yeah i could just look for goodwill but
2:40:22
it's close enough now it's going down buck 23. and so we
2:40:28
think uh so book value actually has gone down since we last saw it in the um since december 31st 2019
2:40:34
but it could be that they just did they net a gain or anything or get some cash we'll need to get an updated one
2:40:42
i've got a review new gold story just make sure it looks like it's still online they're doing asset sales and stuff you know what i mean you're if you're actually executing the asset
2:40:48
sales and stuff it's like all right i'm just seeing that it's unfolding as their they have a plan and it's coming
2:40:54
to fruition doesn't mean it's going to work out but um it's kind of just in a holding position for for gold prices
2:41:01
okay okay let's go let's go let's go let's we at least got to see what the hell happened today you know what i mean
2:41:07
okay boom boom boom so brazil was that was brazil doing it was it just emerging markets or anything
2:41:15
oh because part this is partly because the us dollar was down these are tied at the hip too so the
2:41:21
brazilian real was up to
2:41:26
what do i don't have it there i guess i don't have it there let's not get too fancy talk about brazilian i think i hope that it's in
2:41:33
royale
2:41:38
s p 500 3500 no [ __ ] look at this that's bullish
2:41:45
it's bullish it's super bullish too well this is the daily backup back it up i can't be looking at the s p 500 on the
2:41:51
daily huh well i didn't realize how um whole
2:41:57
overbought this was in january holy [ __ ] it's got some work to do in
2:42:03
the weekly though it's got some work to do but in the daily it's looking promising
2:42:11
wow that's bullish how much time passed six
2:42:18
months it's not that much time past look at this is this month oh that's weekly see what i mean like super bowl
2:42:25
super bullish not quite as bullish but then it kind of got interrupted by something major how about the monthly bullish
2:42:31
bullish not as bullish it's got some work to do it's bullish but not like
2:42:37
rip your ice out bullish just curious in the nasdaq jeez
2:42:46
jeez what do you say same thing though bullish but
2:42:54
it has some work to do too it could be on its way though based on these dailies these dailies look good
2:43:02
all right just curious but an update today okay uh silver up natural gas
2:43:08
hanging naturally with natural gas hanging in there 266 yep what are these doing
2:43:15
kind of kind of hanging in there kind of flat lining a bit ar is hanging in there flat lining
2:43:21
sd they're all flatlining just watching them soon soon it will be a good time to add to me i don't know if i can add to them again
2:43:27
though you know some one of these looked kind of bad
2:43:32
no they look the same they're all the same okay i thought there was one that was looking
2:43:38
bad i can't remember okay and we saw lumber prices oil services or
2:43:45
oil catching a bid yeah solar was looking good gold miles gold mines are up today yeah four percent three percent what the hell new gold do
2:43:55
three percent oh you know what's been crushing me rfp oh this how many times i feel like i'm crying
2:44:01
about this one every damn stream never it was never giving me another chance really sticking it to me
2:44:09
second largest position in the portfolio you know what i mean who might what am i what are you whining about huh
2:44:16
it's just such a higher conviction play
2:44:21
i still keep waiting for the pullback it could come it could come i felt this way before and it came back
2:44:28
to me so but pretty much a quiet day not much happening gold miners trend tech tech up okay copper oh it's copper
2:44:34
up again today too geez those kind of follow track copper huh yeah not much just in favor today because the goal because of uh the us
2:44:40
dollar in in in um in interest rates
2:44:46
these are these are inflation-sensitive companies here if inflation starts ramping up these are going to be big
2:44:51
beneficiaries oh blockchain was up today marijuana nvidia not much okay check the
2:44:58
positions we'll be quick we'll be quick we're doing good resolution why was it about seven
2:45:04
percent today you know what i mean that's that's what kick in the pants like what the hell it's like for
2:45:10
for weeks for months it did nothing it did nothing now it's up seven percent in a day with nothing's going on like ah
2:45:15
pbf this was good huh i didn't add i've been waiting you know what i mean it's kind of just doing it sold off i
2:45:22
think i uh trimmed or sold no i didn't no i kept it on because i liked the chart at the same chart right
2:45:28
all these refiners these are ads you know what nah but it's such a big position for me that i'm just i'm just
2:45:34
waiting i know i mentioned in the last room just waiting for a little bit of a breakout or something i
2:45:40
i made a couple of trades but real small whatever they were they were like try like sold out of a couple real small
2:45:45
positions on things just trying to get that position count down and uh i forget what else cvg i was at 9 today
2:45:53
this one's never going to give me another chance look at this i think i even said that i didn't think that that would hold the time see how much of an idiot i am here you go
2:46:00
what more proof do you need boy it's not going to come back damn well if it give give it more time i may add
2:46:06
same thing with rfp it just won't slow down that's what gets frustrating is when they don't slow down you know what i mean it's like
2:46:11
just hit the brakes flat line for a couple a couple days a couple weeks and then i'll like the setup again but i
2:46:17
can't buy and it keeps going up i just i'll just ride the wave i've done it before right and it's it
2:46:24
can be a good idea i just um it frustrates me too much when it goes it goes against me that's the value investor i mean i can't
2:46:30
i can't get away from it fossils have ten percent how many times we were talking about fossil fuel
2:46:36
by the way i forgot it's as big of a position it is like i made a note like uh research fossil research fossil right
2:46:42
dig into fossil more because i guess i wanted even more but then i'm like oh it's not just it's a good it's an okay
2:46:47
position now it's just a question of adding
2:46:55
ah it's looking okay though huh was there news that wasn't 10 it's kind
2:47:02
of been getting volatile
2:47:10
not nothing it's looking good like i like to you like to see the i mean i'm um
2:47:17
it's not always bad that um the stock starts getting attention and starts bumping up you get a little bit frustrated because you wanted to add
2:47:22
right but it's good because people are starting to pay attention to it starting to get bit up a little bit like you even starting to see with gamestop right now of course there was ryan cohen buying up
2:47:29
all the damn shares from the rest of it no i'm just kidding but like it's good it means it's getting some tractions because then when it does pull back
2:47:34
it maybe it might not be as long of a um i don't know i don't know what i'm
2:47:40
saying like it just means people are starting to get attention because when something doesn't have any intention
2:47:45
like pbf right now there's no like no one's really paying attention to this [ __ ] it's been uh it's almost done nothing since the lows
2:47:51
um it did look like it was starting to get some attention but now it's been almost
2:47:56
what three months from this and now it's not doing anything but um it's only anyway it's good people are trying to pay attention to fossil
2:48:02
again cps this one was tough a big reason this is as big as it is is just because how
2:48:08
high the stock price was i'm not going to lie i mean i've looked at the fundamentals i don't have time right now but uh this stock price was at 140 bucks in
2:48:14
2018. you know what i mean it sounds crazy right it sounds crazy that that weigh on me but it does
2:48:19
it's because i think other people pay attention to this stuff fail fair value as i recall
2:48:24
significantly lower than this significant like well under 100 i even remember then it was leveraged and stuff
2:48:29
and then but i'm like oh i people this will get people's attention sometimes you're just trying to guess
2:48:35
what will get other people's attention which i know that's not the investor way that's not the buffett way but that's my way try to figure out what
2:48:42
are people going to want in a year from now and how much upside do they think it has that's that's the roaring kitty way geez
2:48:50
um cps okay boy an update hey this is looking good huh the timing this
2:48:56
right i've been added to it outside of there i'm sure i um i uh so this is not a bad size position
2:49:04
for i for for this portfolio for the roaring kitty portfolio but i haven't added another account it's like a good not a big position okay but in other
2:49:11
accounts that i have much many fewer positions than this and so i'm a little bit more selective with the positions and but this one i've been
2:49:18
added i'm like yeah this guy's this guy's going to be right and it keeps going up i like timed it right it
2:49:24
was on this pullback i think or maybe on this we'll see
2:49:29
super super risky stock and everything like that but one of those following the breadcrumbs like i feel
2:49:35
like he wouldn't be buying either unless he had another at least a double but probably a triple or quadruple like maybe they're shooting
2:49:41
for 10 or something i'm sorry i just closed that but let's look at the historical price on this one
2:49:53
which would mean this there could be quite a bit more upside look at that chart huh funky
2:50:01
oh flex shopper above two two bucks good thing we added when we did i think
2:50:06
i doubled the position oh this looks good
2:50:14
this looks good remember he got the uh we got the insider buying tell that was sick oh this is looking good is
2:50:22
it starting to get some attention do we add to it again do i add to it again oh [ __ ]
2:50:27
good anyone talking about it
2:50:39
ah all right just make a note of that i mean i don't know i'm gonna do anything with it i just doubled it
2:50:48
remember it wasn't it wasn't asking people but that's one of those has the growth it has some growth uh potential
2:50:59
maybe i might add one more time i don't think it's a percenter though
2:51:05
hey there's revolve so talk about revolve i've been wanted to add i made a note of that somewhere didn't i
2:51:14
yeah i got a little bit ahead of itself i might i gotta start trimming the other ones though i'm at five percent cash i
2:51:20
gotta oh what's my bitcoin doing that's holding up there all right so kind of a green date today huh oh western digital pops seven
2:51:26
percent today shoot oh was the news there [ __ ]
2:51:40
dell hp earnings drive computer damn damn damn damn that was looking rough though wasn't it
2:51:45
i was kind of just waiting to see what was going to happen and pop the wrong way let's keep an eye on it it's not that it's like it it's only
2:51:50
back to where it just dropped which isn't that bullish plus it was oversold this looks still
2:51:56
kind of looks kind of bearish i want to add
2:52:04
i'd park cash there all right 950 keep going keep going
2:52:10
gte oh again it was up there oh because of the inside are buying oh did i pull it up gci
2:52:17
there it is number seven mumbo number seven okay oh
2:52:25
here we go two billion revenues a lot of debt negative tangible book
2:52:36
boy not as much cash flow as i remembered 76 cents operating
2:52:42
simpler free cash flow said 85 cents last year oh that's not bad but see when you adjust for the debt you
2:52:48
see this adjusted [ __ ] this that's what this is this these i'm sorry you can't see this these rows right here simple free cash flow
2:52:57
three year average divided by share adjusted that's share adjusted that's using these adjusted share counts based on this
2:53:03
calculator up here so if it says lever then it goes boom boom boom calculates the new share count and it's always usually an inflated share count so it's
2:53:10
not using 136. sorry it's not using 136 as to sharecom but it's using this new figure of
2:53:16
geez 916. so that's super leveraged it's almost 10x in the sharecon you know
2:53:22
now i need something else this is that insider buying isn't enough hey a like thank you um
2:53:28
yeah thanks thanks derek asking questions i see people liking the stuff too thank you thank you um
2:53:37
i don't know i think i need something else that insider buying wasn't that compelling there's a lot of leverage there all right you know what i need to do is
2:53:42
check the bonds it's been a while since i checked the bonds
2:53:48
oh they got they gotta have something right there they are sometimes you get a typo
2:53:54
the whole name it doesn't show up on the ticker that's because it used to be tegna they they remember they split the business or some [ __ ] i don't remember
2:54:00
those bombs look okay though don't they
2:54:08
that looks better than i expected
2:54:19
it's a gap up huh a little bit of a gap up it's kind of bullish this looks kind of bullish doesn't it
2:54:25
[ __ ] look at this it's very scientific look at this very scientific analysis like
2:54:31
it's flawless
2:54:37
well that looks bullish though [ __ ] i think i gotta add to this
2:54:46
someone else bought it someone someone was talking about i remember thinking you sure about that was it leon cooperman or something
2:54:54
i owned it i mean i'm not knocking on my own it wasn't it's in my it's in the portfolio standard general who was it
2:55:01
ariel they were a value shot by someone no now we're getting into real small
2:55:06
could've sworn someone talked about it fair point fair point i mean is that
2:55:16
wow i'm gonna say add to gci chart i mean i know the story and i um
2:55:23
it doesn't look crazy crazy compelling or anything like that but super discounted all those insiders are buying
2:55:31
insider buying it's a mess
2:55:43
someone come on anyone bearish oh yeah we pulled you we just pulled this up the other day because i remember this
2:55:50
all right but did i not make a note last time
2:55:56
oh yeah i might receive dev and gt all we didn't get into that should be part of the stream too just reviewing past notes you know what i mean
2:56:02
otherwise i forget i was up 13 today huh
2:56:10
ebik's cracker everything's just kind of great five ten percent today on a quiet day too sick okay
2:56:21
not much not much you're just seeing the same pv look kind of interesting huh can you imagine if natural gas prices
2:56:26
start taking off and um i mean if if people are forecasting if
2:56:32
they're thinking trump too i would think coal would start coming back in favor that's what happened in 2016. well that wasn't that wasn't that was
2:56:39
because there was a an expectation that there might be a shoulder some metallurgical coal um at the time and and peabody speaking
2:56:45
that of course it ultimately went bankrupt but um i'm kind of surprised it is in the
2:56:51
gutter as much as it is because of natural gas prices usually natural gas and coal they tend to
2:56:57
i think people think it's going to go bankrupt which it might
2:57:02
i was looking at those options though today
2:57:09
right here january six dollars you're at 30 cents
2:57:17
you can get a five bagger out of that maybe even a ten bag right because if i think if it takes off it takes off it flies that's what i think i think it could
2:57:24
think it gets to 10. so i was looking at those nothing got
2:57:30
executed sometimes i'll put on orders and i don't get executed i uh because i'm i'm really a stickler so
2:57:36
they a lot of them just expire they don't get executed but that was what i was looking at i was thinking ash and then it was up today so that that's not helping things i like to
2:57:42
buy on the down days but um it's probably gonna go bankrupt but uh i like this i like the asymmetry
2:57:52
it's in the portfolio but um i think i'm down on it though i kind of i timed the purchase wrong
2:58:00
should i add more maybe yeah maybe i should add to them maybe i can't believe i'm going to write this in 2020
2:58:07
maybe small
2:58:13
i don't know i would like some i'd like a little bit more on it no one holds it something else man it's real quiet this
2:58:19
is one of those ones where it's quiet and i think it's a bad thing whereas gamestop is quiet i interpret it as a good thing damn
2:58:27
the quiet i mean there's not much news management's not saying anything when i see it with speculative companies i think oh this is bad news
2:58:33
all right now we're in the now okay let's get to the daily mover so can we can we do this in two minutes okay so we'll start with the downs this is good
2:58:39
dx lg probably one i gotta remove that no no time right now i'm playing trying
2:58:44
oh this is the one i sold this today i saw it was down 10 and then some fun sold it's it was a it was it was i think it might
2:58:50
have been almost a triple i didn't catch it all because i wasn't paying attention but i think i got a double on it which is good like it just hit 20 a couple
2:58:58
weeks ago and i just wasn't paying attention stupid i don't even know what it is
2:59:05
ah tuesday there you go there's this bankrupt one the time look at it said 38 cents today
2:59:12
i i think i own it somewhere
2:59:17
the time to buy it was when it dipped back down to twelve when it dipped to 12 cents that was the time to buy it i missed time because i bought it in the
2:59:22
20s and um too risky it's a bank the company's bankrupt and but it looks like
2:59:28
a strong balance sheet it's not in the portfolio right it's in the watch ah damn
2:59:33
i just a little bit this is why it's important to you don't want to pay up too much because then when it sells off and yeah especially the company's already bankrupt i'm like [ __ ] i got it
2:59:40
wrong or um it's really hard to buy more on an average down but if you buy really cheap like i should have been buying at 15
2:59:46
cents i messed that up because i thought it could be uh worth a buck or something but at four bagger on a bankrupt company that's not
2:59:52
good enough upside you know what i mean you know this is like a five solid five bagger but at 15 cents and it
2:59:57
has tangible book value of over a buck i thought that was the ti sorry i missed up that's you got to get that purchase price right
3:00:04
so i wish i waited until it pulled out pulled back just a little bit more and now i regret it because now let's
3:00:09
see what happens it's only a couple days but uh all right leg means they're gonna see a lot of up things today too i mean we can't get this so
3:00:15
any big huge movers not much it's all gonna be about the same hey dave and busters is up 16 what's
3:00:20
that chart looking like all right things starting to some of these um
3:00:27
covered plays turning up gannon was up 13. all right well no time to scream today
3:00:34
screen not a crazy mom okay oh rain air yeah that one looked into i've owned this
3:00:39
before it was a big winner for me back in the day oh it's coming up quite a bit that was one of those ones i didn't pull the trigger on i didn't know if they were
3:00:45
gonna make it i don't think it's in the portfolio was it
3:00:57
yeah i bought it right here as part of the basket purchases and it
3:01:02
got to be i guess it was only a double i thought it was more than that now maybe i got a triple out of it probably not i can't remember
3:01:10
are they going to survive where those bomb prices at [ __ ] they got cellulose and stuff
3:01:21
i can't believe this anyone own it
3:01:32
no damn
3:01:41
now it's a bit too late i don't know if i like it at three bucks i just i made the wrong call that's all
3:01:51
anyone buying no one's buying boring pointing let's see if i get this right boynton is his name
3:01:58
oh sir oh he did buy oh
3:02:05
no
3:02:10
i'm not convinced this wasn't in the portfolio what's the child look like did it just not do anything and i sold out
3:02:18
not always a good idea but uh maybe i might maybe i did
3:02:26
i think i i think i owned it if i saw that inside of buying there's no way i would have passed on that
3:02:33
[ __ ] no buying since though it's kind of weird now it's after 10. don't tell youtube
3:02:39
please don't tell them i went after 10 please please i don't i don't want to lose the stream
3:02:45
ah damn ah all right i'll keep an eye on that i mean because then there's a question of how lumber prices are impacting a business
3:02:51
like that you know what i mean people start turning bullish on that type of a business
3:02:58
i gotta pull up the fundamentals too oh [ __ ] you know what now i gotta do it right now sorry i'm going long go along i gotta
3:03:05
some things i sometimes just gotta finish it
3:03:13
i know i'm thinking about this so there's lots of things to do with the stream and i'm trying to work i've been saying that multiple times like how am i going to work it out what
3:03:20
is it going to be like it's just sometimes you want to do different types of research sometimes it seems like it should be open-ended
3:03:25
though like derek you're asking good questions today and like seems like it could be more open-ended
3:03:31
and then some days it should be more company focused like these times we're doing a lot of tracking which is good stuff during these streams but
3:03:36
diving deep into companies we haven't done that too many times but like that's an important part of research but i guess right now i'm just trying to catch up on
3:03:42
stuff but like i'm making a lot of notes of like hey come back to this come back to this but but i haven't been so that maybe
3:03:48
there'll be there'd be streams dedicated to just doing a couple of of diving deeper into companies
3:03:54
um but it need for the for the audience sake for your sake you need to know what you're doing tune it into you know what i mean and i
3:04:00
don't even know what i'm tuning into when i'm sitting down from the stream right now but i'm i'm looking at long i'm a long long term thinking that there would be
3:04:07
different streams for different types of experiences different types of research all stuff i'm doing you know what i mean
3:04:12
but um but it needs to be communicated um to you
3:04:18
you know you tune in for 90 minutes of watching uh what's his name ryan cohen videos um so i'll give it
3:04:24
more thought we'll see we'll see how things unfold if it'd be helpful if gamestop really works out because that would that could
3:04:30
i could change things um all right so let's see fundamentals
3:04:37
did i get the right thing ryan okay i just need you know i just wanted to check the balance sheet the book book value real quick
3:04:44
yeah it's always super leveraged you know what i mean i bought it back in 2016. it was a spin-off that's what it was and
3:04:50
it was a spin-off trade and at a fraction of what book value would have been in the pro forma balance sheet it was taking like
3:04:55
a third of it i'm like this is easy spin off i mean that's a that's a rule of thumb it works i vouch for it um
3:05:02
although i haven't there's a website that tells you about spin-offs and stuff i used to track it pretty closely but i haven't been lately i should try to find that
3:05:08
it's like spinoffs.something it's how i came across this one it was sick triple oh it's a good nine bucks in book value
3:05:15
but leverage though huh wait how would the bones look what did we say oh [ __ ] did i miss him nope they were
3:05:23
bouncing back they were bouncing back that's right in the 60s but when would they do
3:05:30
oh i'd buy this again i guess this is looking real good okay it's
3:05:36
almost looking like bankruptcies okay so this was a 550 so this is this most of their debt
3:05:42
when does it do offering date in 2014 what's it do 2024 10-year debt five and a half
3:05:49
percent right different business now but uh okay so how much what's the total amount
3:05:54
of debt that we see in these financials oh man we don't have time to be wasting going all over the place
3:06:02
book value i'm just looking for aggregate debt right here total debt
3:06:09
okay so that's half of it that 500 so they have another round of death all right
3:06:20
1.7 billion 1.7
3:06:40
look at that operating casual still positive the whole damn time you know what i mean for they had them they had a really negative announcement late last year
3:06:47
it was something like um they weren't even sure they could continue as a going concern they had to get waivers on some [ __ ]
3:06:52
now it's coming to me as i look at this stuff and i was looking i remember then i was weighing on me too that was waiting on
3:06:58
me because i'm like oh [ __ ] i uh then with then when covet hit i'm like oh how are they gonna be able to bounce back from this considering they
3:07:04
were already in trouble last fall you know what i mean then i'm like that was why i didn't pull the trigger now it's coming to me
3:07:10
i mean i need to dig back into that and they had the waivers there was
3:07:16
something like that this is all from memory so i don't maybe it's changed they got the waivers or they
3:07:22
on stronger footing but look at this net cash flow this is what this is which two bucks in net cash flow that's that's
3:07:28
good
3:07:33
issuing shares look at this issue share issuance they need some support though is anyone did i
3:07:45
didn't i just look this up it's getting late getting late yeah i didn't see anything
3:07:57
nah man nothing nothing bummer well i'm looking for just one other thing maybe boynton buys one more round
3:08:03
you know but he did buy he bought down there that's that's tough
3:08:10
it increased the position 31 percent ah one more round boynton one more round
3:08:18
look at he was buying back at 13 bucks two and he's buying at three we're right there we're right back to where he was buying
3:08:23
not that damn no one else is touching it though [ __ ] all right i gotta dig deeper into
3:08:33
what it can i say that's it that's what i mean let's say i say dig deeper that should be part like i have to dig deeper
3:08:40
shouldn't i be streaming when i dig deeper it's kind of kind of silly that i would that's
3:08:45
the whole point of education you know what i mean like you got to see the digging deeper into it that's kind of that's that's part of the boring stuff
3:08:51
that's part of the process although you kind of get a hopefully you get the feel for how how it works what i'm looking at i'm looking
3:08:56
at the news releases and stuff and it's similar stuff it's just taking the time to do it um but okay all right that was a nice
3:09:03
little quick check there we got through a lot of stuff but a lot of times spent on game stop today but cheers let's there's nothing there's not
3:09:11
gonna be it's ten o'clock on a friday there's no there's no updates we'll see if there's any uh articles
3:09:16
this weekend on and i doubt it but um it probably hit some headlines but next week let's see uh let's see where gamestop opens next
3:09:23
time we next time we meet sync up it'll be um after gamestop opens on monday i think it will be up but um what the
3:09:30
reaction will be i'm not really sure how big what should be down
3:09:35
it did a kid hour and a half today did this dude's watching me down on one day or something [ __ ] but uh i'm eager for the news articles
3:09:41
and the interviews with him what he says about it that's what i'm really interested in and then of course the earnings now we just we'll see what
3:09:48
will come of earnings it'll be it'll be interesting but yeah that's it cheers thanks for tuning in
3:09:53
