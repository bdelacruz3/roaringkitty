2:57
so much that could be uh i can hang that up somewhere where am i gonna hang them can you hang it on a green screen probably
3:03

3:08
i don't even know if i set this up right did i do it today looks like it looks okay on obs i think we're good all right so um
3:17
long weekend you know let me get this thing off my head i got a this chair came with the pillow
3:22
all right let's see now you got a little sense of what was going on today it looked like uh a lot of stuff was up but at least in
3:28
the roaring kitty portfolio which is always always good news right um but uh but okay oh energy was up today
3:36
okay what else what else was happening today often what did i catch happening today what i mean like sometimes i'll check in it look like
3:42
i forget let's just dive in what i don't need to do what do i need to guess what happened today i don't know
3:47
okay so relatively quiet day but overall i'd say market was up though and i guess that's the big news right is that what
3:53
everyone's talking about because the market making new all-time highs that's it right oh a little bit of a gap up today oh that's that's what people were talking
3:59
about okay oh the stream the stream says it's like not receiving
4:05
smooth i think everything's set up right isn't it sorry about that the i'm getting the alert message on the stream saying
4:10
things are bumpy not sure what that's about but let's keep moving if there's any issues let me know okay so a little bit
4:16
of a gap up today that's kind of but still right there oh is it breaking out all right i don't know one day one day a little bit more time let's see
4:23
it's been a little while since we checked this all right all right so on the weekly huh it's looking pretty good on the weekly
4:29
i feel like it was a week or two ago that we checked up on this but this looks pretty good yeah is that upsetting people i don't
4:36
know wasn't the dow still trying to crank back yep still trying to crank back but
4:41
looking good everything looks good what is there to say maybe it maybe it doesn't end that way i
4:47
don't know but right now
4:54
okay and then what's the russell 2000 i'd like to check the russell 2000
5:00
oh what about the nasdaq one just let me check a couple things it's been a while what is it monday yeah probably should check these on like
5:05
fridays and stuff wow everything kind of gapping up today is that wow wow
5:12
huh what else we got germany remember europe was like kind of lagging and stuff and uh
5:19
what's uh what's the euro next doing still kind of all flat hey let me just
5:24
put let me open up a couple of these because this is kind it's only a couple of days though who cares but i'm just kind of curious
5:30
i think you need to do this once a month or something but japan all flat and what's a good one um
5:37
how about just the wilshire 5000 just about everything everything looks good what are you gonna do just watch sit back and watch you
5:45
know energy was up today huh what's that
5:50
about i didn't i didn't see it totally reflected in the uh portfolio did you see that today
5:57
it was some things were up i didn't think much i didn't think it was up a ton or anything like that
6:07
and what's this xle it's still flat nothing going on there's nothing to report nothing to report keep on moving
6:13
ah who cares oh but remember if we looked on friday though when everything was looking kind of bearish remember this
6:18
was like oh this is something to keep an eye on and lo and behold it was either probably going to break or bounce and i
6:24
i don't think i took any action on friday was kind of just like all right this is something to watch and if we do a little bit of artwork
6:29
here just like that roaring kitty that we just had huh my my daughter would be proud it uh bounces
6:34
like right back up you know what i mean so it's kind of telling it looks like it's bouncing up if there's anything to this the hell do i
6:40
know you you tell me you tell me but it would kind of make sense but bosses right now
6:45
what is this weekly though is it daily oh it's daily what about was the weekly uh kind of in the same yeah weekly is the
6:51
same look at this it's like right there huh wow unless
6:58
there was news today too was there news what if we do this exile mobile
7:09
norwegian asset miss cells that was this okay what's it there we go thank you seeking alpha coming through
7:15
in the clutch energy sector component trading in the green yeah any reason
7:21
a pair of strong storms in the yep golf shut more than half there oh shut down oil that's the thing to keep an eye on
7:26
for i mean oil production but also natural gas production too right um and uh
7:32
because if they knock out like one of those hubs or something all these prices could head up that's not a major part of the thesis but it's something uh
7:38
those supply issues you got to be aware of it's something you don't really get with many other uh industries
7:46
um including today's game wow okay so but nothing big
7:52
so i didn't see natural gas was up though natural gas huh look at this i did see
7:58
this this was something i did see and because it was um those natural gas plays in the royal kitty portfolio kind
8:03
of bouncing back a little bit look at this above 260. remember that for when was that first stream
8:09
august 3rd and it was like we talked about that first day i mean i had no idea this is going to happen but
8:16
also um it's not like i mean this could come right back but we talked about its volatile and stuff but this is hugely bullish on look at this
8:26
okay okay um but not much else
8:35
it's just kind of things just grinding higher today i guess whatever and then uh oil natural gas yeah so the
8:41
price industry guys we'll look at the natural gas plates here in just a second but gold kind of bouncing around now see now i don't even need to pull up the chart i
8:46
kind of know we know what this is we know the price points 1927 copper wasn't it didn't it bounce above
8:52
three there for a little bit uh briefly briefly for a couple days but right on trend there hanging in
8:59
look at that right huh everything looks bullish polish
9:04
and we saw these popping yeah look at the let's just dive a little bit deeper we did we pull up x x yes oh we did it's right there but uh
9:11
what's that on oh is this ois oih that's it yeah they're all gonna say
9:17
the same thing we get it we get it we get it and natural gas right we get it
9:24
okay aerospace and defense up what's that doing
9:34
okay
9:40
the old banks was banking up today interesting
9:46
they kind of followed energy right i mean that's those value stocks everyone calls them value stocks
9:54
that chart looks good though bouncing off the same look at this it's the same it's the same line
10:02
it's the same thing it's the same thing as energy
10:09
that's just banks and then regional banks it's not going to show the same thing we get it we get it it's already 7
10:14
10 oh value there you go i mean i knew we'd we'd come across something there you go
10:19
value stocks right that's good for the roaring kitty portfolio s p
10:25
500 value you can see look at that all track these are all the same this is all the same chart
10:30
um that's what i mean like like oil stocks they're usually a good proxy for value you will probably see
10:36
what about emerging markets
10:41
a little bit different smaller ones a little bit different and um
10:48
just curious but very similar to some location they all kind of peak there on june 8th
10:54
and kind of bounce around now starting to pop up but really no no big moves it's just some something to
11:00
note today that's all it just hasn't given given everything up
11:10
all right i get it you get it i get it we get it is the fix that break below 20
11:18
yet that trend looks down
11:25
bob it's been it's been high for a while huh and you see that reflected in options prices too if you're looking at
11:30
options prices they're all super damn expensive i mean it's good for the options
11:36
positions i own you know but uh trying to buy more forget about i can't
11:42
find much i can't find much in the options front right now i'm um i mean i'm fortunate for the ones
11:47
that i did buy so you know how there's a trade-off but it's how it works and then ens we got that transocean was
11:53
up big today huh oh baitex remember we just added that to the portfolio and that's just gonna it's gonna be some good timing that's
11:59
not how do they how did it why is it light up three percent oh yeah what's rare it's doing i'll check it on
12:05
that just bouncing around there all right kind of good proxy for
12:12
first taking alcoa just crushing it but 15 about to say everything is everything is in this there's not really
12:19
much happening today oh yeah what's good you're doing good year
12:25
that's all the same stuff how many times can you look at the same chart i go crazy that's why i'm like let's just pick a couple i can't scroll through all these
12:31
right now ah this is a good company
12:38
um they uh do uh like the the if you know uh um
12:45
i like baseball cards basketball cards they do cards they do the grading psa and stuff like that it's a good company that i it never quite got cheap enough
12:51
this time so i didn't dabble um but uh boy it bounced back strong
12:56
i've you know what i've been kind of waiting to uh this has been on my radar for five years and uh never it was a dividend player so
13:02
it never got super cheap but you know what i've been waiting for is i thought uh i've been waiting for like a recession
13:07
to dabble in something like this i figured it would sell off hard which you did see in 2018 it sold off real hard fell from 25
13:15
down to it oh it did get below 10. and um but when we're in a recession it's it's it's
13:22
a tougher market because like things like cards and stuff it's not just cards it's sports memorabilia really
13:27
they do everything but there's only a couple players in that industry like psa and what's the other one there's um
13:33
yet there's a third one bgs and um but i always thought it's it's like more
13:40
uh risk on behavior you know what i mean and so we never got that really prolonged recession i had this big
13:46
pullback right here but even then it didn't get that cheap it's pretty impressive and uh so i've been kind of waiting for it to get it's a good company don't i
13:53
mean this is a uh this is one where maybe i should have pulled the trigger for more of that
13:58
pulled the trigger for more that like compounder type style but i'm trying to try to i'll try to like i mentioned in
14:04
some of my videos i tried to diversify my investment style i'm a deep value i'm a deep value guy but um in the same
14:10
way i'm looking for trendy stocks i'm also looking for good businesses and there's a case there's a strong case to be made i could have been buying this in march but
14:16
i never would have gone super heavy because i didn't i don't know my outlook isn't like 10
14:21
years but looking out this 10 years this could be a good company just because of its it's it's
14:27
it's strong position and a unique industry whatever anyway it's been in this column this whole time and it's boy it's
14:33
really bounced back strongly
14:40
blockchain oh what's bitcoin doing it's like monday i feel like get
14:45
get caught up in everything man nothing looks bullish to me
14:55
it's holding up you know what i mean is this weekly i guess this is bullish
15:03
i'm not i'm not doing anything but all right everything looks how do you not look at today what's marijuana doing that's one i don't have
15:10
any exposure right now oh it's a little bit bearish but also could
15:15
be a time to add real this is uh i mean what what the hell do i know about
15:22
um i mean marijuana is one thing but the investing investing in marijuana you
15:28
know the industry it's a tough industry and many of these players probably won't be around um
15:34
for the long term who knows it's one of those
15:42
but there could be some big winners out of this this is kind of why i included in this column who did i include just canopy just just can't i just
15:48
picked a big name there's a number of players but i'm not an expert in the industry but i always thought maybe maybe it deserves a
15:54
position in the portfolio for just a risk on not a big position what the hell do i know i don't know much about
15:59
um with which of these players are going to survive over the long term i'd probably
16:05
just go with the big names and invest but you could think because of it's a it's a new new industry here and some
16:10
one of these could take off but i don't know this looks kind of interesting now what's the take on marijuana these days huh
16:19
it's not real as you can tell it's all my style you know what i mean deep value investor what the hell would i even be looking at these for but i got you know
16:25
i got the that bitcoin position or the bitcoin trust whatever it is like i'm not a
16:30
i'll dabble in these just to play but it wouldn't be a high conviction i forget some other names you remember
16:36
some other names i should toss some others in here just to keep an eye on it but if this is a good etf which i'm not even sure
16:43
i mean this looks terrible i mean that looks i don't know what i'm
16:48
talking about here but it's more just uh like the industries it's one of those i don't know it
16:54
actually looks way more bearish than some of the other risk on things huh almost two bears like bitcoin i think all right that
16:59
looks bullish sure even something like a tesla looks bullish but this this looks bad if you can't look good in this type of
17:05
if you're the marijuana industry you can't even look good in this environment i don't know what that's a little bit of a turn off you know what i mean and this doesn't look
17:12
good i don't know all right anyway i'll just i'll keep on watching i'll keep it here i'll keep on watching it but i can't do
17:18
anything here ah and this one i put some space stocks too you know what i mean i liked it i
17:24
like this risk i like this wrist column this is sick it's kind of bouncing all over the place
17:30
you know what i mean you got to be holding up pretty well in this environment for it to be interesting but that was that other one nickel or something i don't know maybe that's
17:35
probably a good one to add to this too you know i mean i i don't think i can pull the trigger on some of these but
17:42
what is the ticker let me look at that that one looked ridiculous didn't oh i want to look up test what time is it 7
17:48
17. we're doing okay this is just pulling up a couple look at this huh
17:55
i mean what's tesla doing
18:00
damn it looks good wow i mean now i don't have any more
18:07
forecast the 2000 was just about it you can't can you really say three thousand
18:12
i don't think you can't really say you can't really
18:17
say uh i pulled out the profile i had to pull up the summary
18:23
375 ah at some point at some point the value and yeah it needs to
18:28
put a stop on it but i don't know all i know is right now it still looks bullish so what else can you go off of what else can you go off of
18:33
i but you see the weekly so look at this huge remember this hugely bullish rsi
18:40
now it's kind of pulling back a little bit and this is in does the book say bearish blah blah blah
18:46
but as the books say the value books you wouldn't touch this in the first place that it's ten bag is it a ten bagger it's a ten beggar
18:56
what am i doing that's all that all the investments say huh i should i what i should've you know i didn't buy it as you know
19:01
i'll buy when the return looks like it's breaking out i did not buy it right here but this was super bullish this breakout
19:07
right here last year um it was a mistake not to be buying it and uh what was it december
19:12
this was hugely bullish and it was a mistake not to at least get a starter position you know what i mean i um just there's been a lot going on and um
19:21
but that was usually bush and then remember then it pulled back i mean how many times are going to say then i pulled back to this area right here it was a good time to buy i should have
19:26
been buying so i mean i'm a value investor right but this was from everything you see here it was a
19:31
worth taking a position and does that make me none of it does that make me a bad value investor i don't know maybe it does i don't think
19:38
so but uh ah i don't know okay enough with the wrist calm let's
19:44
check out what the roaring key portfolio was doing today let me just close out of some stuff the stream looks like it's holding up okay
19:49
all right let's check the portfolio let's hope for some green huh we'll get a secret oh
19:54
so much green yeah i got my phone on me um
20:01
wow lots of green today huh rfp huh damn that day i'm gonna complain about
20:09
not i should be happy right second it's the second position the portfolio and it's crushing it but this day was
20:16
the day i was supposed to add right below three standing by orders you're gonna have the standing by orders out there damn
20:21
and now it's not gonna give you another opportunity to add it what am i supposed to do i'll wait i'm waiting for a pullback right now i'm totally gonna add
20:27
to this it was like i said it's a high conviction play it's why it's such a big position in the portfolio and then what the hell's lumber doing
20:32
what's this doing today look at that
20:38
wow yeah this is inevitable these big you can't have this much volatility on the upside or the downside and not have
20:44
a reversal of some sort even if it's just one day this is such a big move you'd expect this to persist for a little bit here i
20:51
human nature you know what i mean um but um what was rfp up for so much today
21:00
i can't believe the market's gonna stick it to me on this one
21:09
what was it that was wednesday what's the date today 24th as lumber futures right what's this impose unfair tariffs on canadian lumber
21:16
and a decades old dispute with the us
21:23
there was nothing on rfp though right
21:28
well this is oh this is where i am i'm an idiot i meant to look up a lumber or something but um all right all right we'll just
21:35
wait just keep on waiting ah what am i where am i going where am i going sorry about that
21:42
i hate when the high conviction now i just gotta wait for it to pull back that's uh that's that's uh i need to put that restriction
21:49
on myself now i can't chase it because i've kicked my i've done this i've done it so many times i've i've i've added on the breakout and i feel so
21:56
stupid when it heavily pulls back i mean everyone i'm not saying it happens every time it doesn't but it's already the second largest
22:01
position now it's like all right just ride it and take the gains and blah blah blah um cnr
22:06
holding up after the after broke out on earnings and stuff ngd gold just hanging in there
22:12
tse was up eight percent today that's sick i'd up this position
22:18
i've this is like uh i'd up this ah it's just grinding higher you know what
22:24
i mean chemicals um i mean i really believe it's worth 50
22:31
i like strongly believe it's worth 50 bucks plus that's why it was the top it was a tough position in the portfolio
22:37
for like a lot of march and april which turned out to be a good decision i made
22:43
i mean it turned out to be it was like holding its value quite well which i was pretty happy about and i felt strongly about what the value
22:49
was and the size of the company i was pleased with that decision that it held up as well as it did
22:55
and uh and now it's just been a slow mover so the other ones are kind of outperforming all right no big deal it's uh
23:00
it's just what it is this size of the company too um but uh yeah this is uh i like this
23:07
and then what happens to is then you start get i mean you you deal with this right then what happens is you start getting the winners right everything starts working in your favor not
23:13
today isn't you don't go off of one day right i'm talking multiple months and then you start
23:18
thinking all right i'm right about everything so then you start buying more of everything which i'm definitely feeling
23:24
a little bit of or i'm like i need to put more on this one but put more on that one um oh speaking of which oh i didn't even
23:30
say look at games i added more games gamestop oh yeah little dice would i skip right over it
23:37
look at this they pulled back today after the run-up on friday i bought more
23:42
i don't know if i could buy any more from me i mean i own some outside of the rowing kitty portfolio too right but as far as roaring kitty portfolio i
23:48
think this is it i bought in this pullback today and i was down like eight percent of one time then it pulled back pretty strong i
23:53
was like what the hell is going on here look at that oh that's intraday oh what
23:59
the intraday you don't want your day what am i what am i day trading
24:04
look at this yeah i i i bought on this pullback i'm like what the hell there's no news or anything like that these volatile highly shorter stocks you're
24:10
gonna see that happen i'm like uh all right i wanted to i said this i wanted to pull the trigger one more time on a
24:16
on a good chunk and the market gave it out today i'm like all right this is it because um we're getting so damn close to what i
24:22
consider is going to be a busy new season we're like days away weeks away earnings will be mid-september i suspect
24:28
probably between september 10th and september 15th based on when they announced last year in the timing of everything maybe give or take a double date what
24:34
the hell do i know but um couldn't they announce they could announce some news before that but i expect it's going to be a relatively still
24:40
they got one more rough quarter but but now we're so close to the consoles coming out in what i consider really
24:45
good news we're gonna have super powerful year-over-year comes like it's almost gonna be they got like one more like
24:51
questionable quarter to get out which could already be priced in right i mean i'm bet i believe it's already priced in but um
24:57
once they get that out like there could just be a string of just good news good news good news and so we're right on this cusp of like a four
25:03
week period right here and uh it's like the kind of final positioning you know what i mean and so it pulled back eight percent
25:09
today when everything else was up people probably just toss it on the side and buying all the other value stocks end up but then it bounced back
25:15
strong i'm i was up on the day i'm like sick but anyway is this is a big position for the roaring
25:22
kitty portfolio i hate i handle the other accounts differently that i handle this roaring kitty portfolio and um
25:28
like it's been i tried i want to keep it more diversified and blah blah blah and um but i i i feel like the downside
25:36
is real when i look at everything when i i know i repeat myself over and over again but when i look at the other positions in the portfolio
25:42
and i compare the asymmetry between how much how much further they could fall down or or how much upside they have upside
25:49
asymmetry you get that but um like it still looks super compelling to me and so then i start worrying am i am
25:55
i crazy um that's why if you have feedback on those videos feel free to i don't care
26:00
if you agree with me or disagree with me i'm i am super curious because and then people make fun of mike barry
26:06
like damn something might be wrong with us or we're either really right and even when i compared to like an rfp
26:12
right now at the current price point i've been hugely bullish on rfp it was a super steal back when i was one two bucks here less so
26:19
like um and the downside i feel is more meaningful than say a gamestop per se it gets really when you get into the nuance
26:24
here it's really tough i can't say that so confidently but um with the amount of cash that gamestop has and what i think it's going
26:30
to generate over the next couple years i just think it's uh it's it's it continues to be a silly price point below five bucks here at 300 million
26:36
market cap uh anyway so i added today i meant to so we have 15 which is oh
26:42
i mean i look like an idiot now and this it's like the only videos i've uploaded it's like
26:48
uh anyway there'll be more i hope you i'll upload more videos i know i mentioned that on friday but um looks like pretty decent feedback on
26:54
that gamestop video so people like that i'll do that for some of these other things oh you see me post a couple of um uh did
27:00
i oh i didn't post this stream on twitter today hey let me just do that real quick oh you can't see me i i do i do it over
27:06
here i just post this real quick but then what i'm gonna do is you know what i should be doing and i i should be um
27:15
i made a couple of posts oh sorry i can't see the thing anymore i made a couple of posts here um on some of the companies that we
27:23
talked about i should be doing i know i should be doing this so one thing i'm not i uh like i'm not being pro active on
27:29
a lot of these websites and stuff like that but that's because i just don't have the time i'm like focused on other stuff right now i'm focused on the research per se
27:35
but really as i get in the swing of things as we kind of build a routine on the live streams which i know we haven't done yet i apologize for
27:41
that but we'll rule routine eyes does that work we just make that up and we'll get more more routine i'll have
27:47
more time to do this type of stuff but for right now i'm focused more on the research itself but like i figure i mean we talk about this stuff we take these
27:52
good notes um reminder notes right this isn't thorough analysis or anything like that
27:58
you think we don't know that we know that but it's like once you're dialed into these companies it's good to look at there's only a
28:03
couple bullet points you pull it up you check it out and uh it reminds you say hey let's look into this and so
28:09
i forget when i did this yesterday saturday i don't remember i looked at some of these notes and i was pulling up some of the things i'm
28:14
like oh yeah this looks kind of compelling you know what i mean i so uh so and i know we talked about a
28:21
couple of these on friday and i'm like i should let me just put this on twitter so stuff like this i mean i'm supposed to be doing more of this that's how this
28:27
works i know that but i'll get there i just you gotta give me some time give me some time but um
28:33
so i didn't buy any more ngs for the morning kitty portfolio yet i think i
28:39
did buy a little bit more uh forum fet and i'll buy more of these though i'm kind of
28:45
i gotta raise some cash i gotta raise cash period and so i've
28:50
been uh i trimmed some position oh and we took this note too on friday uh trim cve
28:59
oh is my thing not working i thought that mean that thing means it's working no
29:05
i gotta let that highlighted thing i need a new highlighter thing anyway see these two right there can i just tell you i trimmed cve and
29:11
xcc i figured too because i was buying those um i bought some more sandwich and i bought some more ontaro those still
29:18
oh those were up today because i mean every a lot of stuff was up today no big deal but um i just need to raise cash so i'm
29:24
down to look at you look at these damn positions how many positions are i'm blocking i'm sorry about that
29:29
let me pull this over a little bit there we go all right so
29:36
what are we down to one i think i saw it today i think i saw like 140
29:42
all right of nominal of non-nominal positions i think it's like 145 or something like that right here i think
29:48
cndt i think i saw that in the portfolio this is the i think that's the smallest one um and
29:54
then these are all just nominal positions as you can tell by the percentage of the portfolio i kept them in there just because uh just for now again i don't usually do
30:01
this but i i felt compelled to manage like this type of portfolio differently this year
30:06
and now i found it helpful to have so many positions in the portfolio we can see what's moving and stuff like that but also because
30:12
we're not i don't feel like we're totally out of the woods on everything yet so kind of just just reminders for me really but uh
30:18
there's just such small position i just keep them in there but anyway i need to start this is ridiculous it's still ridiculous but as
30:24
as time passes i'll uh as time passes i'll i'll pull back in these positions because i feel more comfortable with
30:30
where we are and the market and so forth but um slowly but surely just takes time
30:36
anyway i need to trim out some of those i need to get the cash position back up oh here i got this did i update this
30:42
yeah yeah look at the cash 0.6 percent i may look back in this stream and be like
30:48
what the hell was i thinking but i'm in the process of of raising the cash it's because i pulled the trigger on
30:53
on gamestop today whereas i i went out i didn't have a firm plan to do that but uh
30:58
yeah we'll see oh now it's so energy's still twenty percent even this one i mean energy's still 20
31:04
even after i trim that you know what i mean um
31:09
point six percent though ah oh that makes me uncomfortable i don't know about you but uh i have
31:15
other i have other accounts besides of our own kitty portfolio but i i care about the management of the
31:20
roaring kitty portfolio and so i i it's much more of a your traditional portfolio manager approach where i try
31:26
not to screw up with this type of stuff and this is a little bit extended given where we are at the market but it will
31:31
take me a couple trades to raise cash right um and this is mostly gamestop
31:37
right 32 what is it 15 it's half half of that is gamestop but then energy i'm still
31:42
bullish on energy material see what i mean these market everyone value's been working hasn't it
31:48
um contributors graduating energy materials i kind of forget like i got all this
31:53
for better or worse in particular oil gas equipment instead
31:59
of metals and mining chemicals six percent
32:04
i haven't looked at this in a little while let's just check this i'm sorry hold on industrials let me pull this over a
32:09
little bit come on can i can i fit it oh i can fit it nice
32:15
cash industrials i'm bottom-up i mean you know what i mean uh this is a reflection of my bottom-up stock picks
32:20
which i always find interesting because i know people do the top-down stuff right and they go i need this much explorer that much explosive but i do the
32:26
bottom-up stuff i'm focused on the individual companies but then i back out i'm like ah so this is what i was thinking but who's surprised by this i'm a value
32:32
investor um see i'm always going to end up in these types of plays but like i mentioned i try to diversify my styles and
32:39
what you see here i wanted this to this should have been higher because i wanted to buy some more some trendier stocks and uh but
32:46
next time and i'll i'll get on the swing of things as we as we get we get that uh that trendy
32:53
section of the the spreadsheet of um i don't know i don't know what i'm doing
32:58
i think i have a plan in my head but i don't know i just i'm faking it until i make it you know no um specialty retail that's all game
33:06
stop equipment and sir all right so chemicals household durables i don't know aerospace and defense
33:13
okay and how about that look at this hey that looks better hey look how diversified i am
33:19
ah
33:28
computer electronics retail i guess it's gamestop you know what i mean some of these are like weird i mean i guess games.com that's gamestop
33:34
but still you don't think of computer i think gaming and this is the sub industry too right so you expect it to be a little but
33:40
anyway oil and gas home building home building look at this whole building's still up
33:46
the whole building just crushing it what uh just crashing
33:51
it and gold's been dropping just because everything else is now performing well while it's stabilized a bit so it becomes a smaller percentage of the
33:57
portfolio refining that's mostly pbf at this point i think i trimmed
34:02
holly biotek's still one percent interesting i forget all the names
34:08
pharmaceuticals those are all nominal all right all right good to check up on i don't know
34:14
okay i don't know what i'm actually going to i don't need to pull these out this is the thing we know value was up today this is why it's good to start
34:20
with the dashboard um so unless you see something up huge today like rfp that's surprisingly big was there any filing do i have sec
34:26
hidden in here i feel like i say that every time google oh let's let's let's do that hey
34:32
let's do this this is going to be you so much more i know i so i've realized i haven't used
34:37
it during the stream this much but this is this is sick when you need to like quickly home in on the different engines
34:42
like the different companies within the industry and now let me just check um
34:49
oh it's not forest products where does it fall under is it not forest products where does it go under paper products so look at this so look
34:55
at this so we can do this too and right off the bat you see it was up 13 within this sub industry the
35:00
yeah these are based on sub industry and uh but everything else wasn't up any nearly okay now i got to check this
35:11
nothing 24th nothing i mean who knows what's going on with this company
35:16
ah which which of course as it's turning out was was a bullish indicator which it sometimes is sometimes
35:22
sometimes quiet is bad if you go if you're in like a really high risk company um if you're if you're in like a really
35:29
high risk speculative play and something like that and you know like management's supposed to be doing stuff and you aren't here much actually you're not here much with
35:34
gamestop right now but this is a good example but i actually think this is bullish but uh with some more riskier stocks or
35:40
if you know if they go quiet and they're not they're not chanting with the vessels that's a bad sign so i have sold out or trimmed heavily
35:47
on like the silence is bad news i don't like this i don't like this um you know with rfp that was kind of
35:53
weighing on me a little bit in eight march april may june but there's a lot of value investor
35:58
there was a good there was enough good stuff where it shouldn't wait on me as much as it did i but there was just so much uncertainty
36:03
right we're all in the same boat there blah blah blah um and um
36:08
and so because it was super quiet not much was happening no one's really taking any positions i'm like what's going on here no one's no insider
36:14
buying no anything and it has this turning out that was bullish and i should have been buying more and by more and it's already a big position
36:19
in the portfolio so i'm just like i'll just sit on it we'll wait opportunistically add and stuff like i just missed and here it is
36:26
it's almost a five it's gonna be a five burger and i had said i think i mentioned this on the stream i said it to a friend on that day
36:32
all right this is my last so much of this stream is uh be lamenting but on that day i said this
36:38
is gonna be one of my 10 baggers there's like five of them that i was like super dialed into it happens during
36:43
major pullbacks where i have this feeling that this is this has ten like solid ten mega potential there's already
36:48
a ton of ten beggars out there i feel like i'm saying the same exact thing i said last time i can't remember camping world was a 10 mega i didn't
36:54
think that that was necessarily going to be a short term 10 bagger but i didn't think it was going to be a 10 bag of potential because i was still
36:59
buying it like 10 and 15 so so it's camping world rfp tech never got
37:04
cheap enough this time tech was on the last time and um and like antero i didn't think
37:10
antero at the time it's it's it's not looking like it could be but i was like super
37:15
there's a there's a couple of i forget off the top of my head um anyway so this is sick i like this i
37:21
don't know if you track industries and sectors and stuff like this but when you can quickly pull in and this is helpful for when you're screening too so if
37:27
you're if you come across a company um and you think okay what's going on i got some of the
37:33
more important stuff with the percentage gains to get to the 52 high six month insider buying
37:38
is it not working right now oh sometimes it's not working and then uh the business and stuff and
37:43
then uh then you can just quickly see and i can even sort by different things it's sorted by market cap so you can see it's a smaller player in this space
37:50
but um yeah i guess so what about materials generally anything
37:56
up bright green see the bright i don't see any bright green across the board the colors are industries like gray is like this is a
38:02
similar industry paper and forest products and this is container in packaging well not much break green today so rfp
38:08
leading everything interesting
38:16
yeah oh olm was up today huh oh they bought so look at this big move up huh
38:24
i don't know why i mean every value was up today right but look at this so they but they bought before right and
38:31
we were just waiting because that chart was looking bad right now the charts like starting to look all right maybe it's maybe it's got some life it's not
38:36
totally given up yet this is a good sign um but they bought another 100k
38:41
what was this i feel like i didn't pick it up during the stream i don't remember it oh it's today they filed it today so
38:48
another 100k same same guy scott
38:53
this is looking good
38:59
wait what is this oh this is from 2019 whole hill okay um but we're up over 500k 600k now
39:06
sick yeah keep it um oh let's get back to this
39:14
continue keep close eye more insider buying
39:22
so commodity cap so chemicals was just crushing it today you know what i mean um that's why trincea was up
39:30
however you pronounce it trincio transayo i don't know okay all right back to the portfolio
39:38
all right let's just go through pbf all right and then uh just one other thing i just want to train so entero's bouncing back so this is going to look like this
39:44
is going to be good it could be could have been good timing on that purchase you know what i mean it's up every day since let's see
39:50
but nothing else really going on it's the same old story everything still looks bullish pull back um
40:00
and then let me just say eqt all right
40:08
you know just everything's there yeah there's no real news today you know what sandwich is this is still looking i've been po i'll be checking so some stocks
40:14
i'm going to check up on more frequently what i'm like trying to add or um or i think there's quite a bit of upside so all on it as
40:21
sandridge one that i didn't i didn't wasn't even the portfolio that could be that has 10 bag of potential from these lows
40:26
that could be eight bucks it was it was just eight bucks it's eight bucks last year it was that
40:33
was it april uh not quite not quite 12 months ago um that like previous highs and stuff that stuff
40:39
matters i it all comes down to value and stuff but all right every oh travels i did see
40:45
this travels we just talked about it that on friday didn't i think on friday this has got a lot of operating leverage
40:52
this this thing can run up big um but it's risky and speculative but they own those um
40:58
like gas stations on the side of highways and stuff you've seen them travel centers i think that's even the name of a lot of
41:04
them but um is it the port noise have like control of the company and it hasn't like
41:10
historically been super well run but just a ton of oh here we go this is one where i'd like to look at the metrics
41:16
here some insider buying but not much
41:21
excuse me this was probably up so much because it's got a low float i think market cap solid 322 i like that
41:29
it's at it's 50 is it at it's 50 4 to 52 week high so it's right there yeah look at that that doesn't sound
41:37
that doesn't seem right it's got more than that um look at this 5 billion in revenues
41:44
big company game stops bigger which i didn't realize boy i uh
41:54
oh i forgot i forgot that okay uh yeah travel set it's 5 billion in revenues like serious look at this so 29.2 i'm bad at this
42:01
29.2 it trades at three it now trades at three percent of revenues
42:07
a lot of upside operating leverage if they can just turn become profitable and stuff and uh
42:14
and um yeah i i i i'd like to add i haven't so i added i
42:19
did a good job adding but sub 10 i knew that was cheap i missed it in july
42:26
now i'll just watch it i mean i don't know if it could get back here could it i don't oh boy that now
42:32
that's not even that far away anymore boy it's really run up high it never got as cheap as i thought it
42:38
was going to get that must be the operating language i remember thinking like this maybe it's not as risky as i thought it was
42:44
because they kind of got control of it they kind of keep it also there's some it's um some related party transactions
42:50
because of the the port noise who own it and stuff rmr i think are they the ones who run this
42:56
um or i think was it the port noise run rmr i forget
43:02
to start at the top of my head um maybe on a pullback
43:07
i gotta dig back into it too um but the pullback's got to be sizeable
43:13
maybe 15.
43:22
can i just i need i should come up with some acronyms pull back pull back to 15.
43:28
nothing to do boy that was up 30 percent though huh not much else
43:33
well then we saw everything up eight percent this is just oh just all value fossil moving i didn't buy more but i
43:40
know we said that i should have because it never really pulled back after that leave what the hell happened
43:45
here anything happen i don't even think anything happened that's that's kind of annoying when that
43:50
happens i think the insiders bought did they buy more
43:58
no they didn't bust in stream i mean they bought a ton in june i definitely said this at some point not
44:04
enough people were talking about it but i don't know why it ran up those those couple days whatever spr
44:14
dbi dbi is still under seven rvlv
44:20
did i did i i've already added to dvi right
44:25
i'm surprised i'm surprised i haven't added more but it's still under seven my am i nothing anything happened recently no
44:32
nothing happened recently i like that it's still under seven
44:38
though hmm and fossil below six
44:49
i mean who i know people like people why would you watches right who cares but um
44:56
it's about asian it's about asymmetric upside it's always about that and they had a pretty pretty damn strong balance sheet now i gotta check it
45:05
813 a couple weeks ago i got the date over there that's why i'm always looking over there for the date
45:12
and i sure can't remember it so all right here we go look the market cap is what
45:19
300 277 in cash like right off the bat there's other stuff to consider blah blah blah blah but
45:26
jeez total car and assets oh yeah you know
45:32
what i know you know what i noticed i and i when i posted these two like positive net nets i care about that
45:37
i don't always pick up on it right away because i don't i feel like i haven't said it too much in the stream but i was looking at both these like
45:43
something like fet super sp i mean on a relative basis
45:48
um i mean it's just it's a speculative high-risk energy play that's i mean they're buying back bonds at 40 cents on the dollar you know what i mean like
45:55
you know if your bonds are trading in 40 cents and you're able to buy them back you're in a position you know what i mean
46:00
um but to be in that position and still have a positive net net obviously trading below net net is the whole gram
46:06
style right but to just even have a positive net where your current assets are greater than all of your liabilities they had
46:11
like a good surprisingly high amount of cash and the same thing with ngs which already had a strong balance sheet much
46:16
um a much different uh level of risk of credit risk than um fvt but uh i just
46:23
they both said to me i'm like oh yeah this is worth mentioning so this was me trying to like boil down to a couple
46:29
um um what is it 100 is it still 140 is there more than 140 on twitter i forget
46:34
um get the whole thesis and this is the thesis that's what i mean i feel like i can get this video short this is the whole thesis what more do
46:40
you need to know besides this stuff it's good you usual sorry i'm talking about fet now i'm
46:46
jumping all over the place but this is my point when i'm looking at some of these names i'm like this is it and so we go back to fossil i
46:51
like i'm not going to make some long pitch about um oh i sorry didn't i see a good
46:56
post today by uh someone posted a thing about what bill miller says about a thesis i couldn't agree with more like he's
47:02
um about like you think suppose your thesis can be so simple so short and it's funny i posted this on sunday and then someone
47:08
posted that today i'm like yeah i agree you should be able to tell your whole damn thesis in a minute or two which is why those hour long game stuff videos
47:14
are silly but is why i've been cutting it down because it doesn't have to be that long it's more to just for the people who just want to learn
47:20
about how to perform that type of research but um the actual thesis itself if you're trying to get people's attention
47:25
you should be able to do it in a tweet as well um now on a relative basis that takes more work
47:31
that's that's what we're doing during these streams right you need to compare it to other plays i mean you can't just and it needs to be the context of the
47:36
portfolio blah blah blah but the stock pitch itself um could probably be
47:42
could probably be shared at a 140 characters i forget um so anyway so fossil i see this and um
47:49
i don't think it is it is a net is that a positive net net
47:55
i've never done any back tests or anything like that maybe some people have obviously traded below net net is one thing but if you take
48:01
like my style and i've never really seriously integrated it but he took my style of value investing you
48:07
cut down because a big risk that i deal with is bankruptcy risk right and then if you just looked at some positive net nets and like that was a
48:15
uh like a quality variable if you will it probably i suspect it might perform
48:21
well i don't know let's test it let's see how ncs and fet and i guess even uh fossil turns out they don't have lease
48:27
oh they do have leases but they they cancel out 200 so they have 240 million in debt cap
48:33
and cash covers total debt you know what i mean like this is the stuff i see this is why i'm like i don't i'm not going to make my sorry this is
48:39
where i was going with that i'm not going to make a pitch to you on watches i i don't know i mean i'm not even wearing a watch i um
48:44
and i've never owned a fossil watch but i know it was historically it was which is past performance isn't
48:52
always indicative of future forms blah blah blah blah um but if they used to crush it back in
48:58
the day so we'll check that off we'll pull it up and anyway now as i'm looking at the balance sheet again i'm like oh this this looks good this is as a july 4th
49:07
it's like super positive net net but the question is people are saying it's it's similar to a gamestop wrist
49:13
and people like no no one wants this anymore no one wants your there's other there's competition in this case i mean they got smart watches
49:20
and stuff although i'm sure fossils trying to get in that space right i it's fossil
49:25
oh let's close out some of this stuff confusing me um oh i was going to pull up the
49:32
fundamentals that's what i was doing um i just want to see if anything sticks out to me different income
49:37
lease liabilities such a clean balance sheet too so simple so simple inventories and people say oh
49:43
the inventories aren't worth that much and now i'd be curious too which is the has the management team been flipped over are they are they trying to
49:49
do similar stuff to like what the gamestop management team is doing that's the thing is that you get the right folks in there that's what i was saying with fvt sorry i'm
49:55
jumping all around but like um they did have some management changes but that wasn't a big part of this thesis so i didn't even include it
50:02
but they're they're like they're trying and um with the bond they did the tender offer
50:07
and then the bond exchange and like they're going for it they may not they may not succeed but they're going for it uh and in the case of not ngs when
50:14
the case of gamestop they changed the whole management team after they dropped the ball for years and all those shitty acquisitions and stuff
50:19
and when people think game stuff they think oh it's a secular risks and no one cares anymore but like the management team is trying to change that they may
50:25
they may not succeed either in like transforming the business and stuff but they're trying and it's a new team
50:31
and so that's the things maybe fossil has this too and i don't know off the top of my head if for a bigger position i probably would but um
50:38
but that's the thing maybe it could be i certainly liked it more three bucks than i do
50:50
i certainly liked it more yeah three bucks than i do it's oh is it really about to double is there can't have been no news right
50:58
come on
51:04
anyone no one i recognize here really small name strap see what i mean no there's been nothing
51:10
it just it just went up oh they they announced they beat but oh so they beat so okay so it was front
51:15
running a little bit that was the beat but it was already at five bucks it was at five bucks and now it's like
51:21
but that's the thing sometimes these names run up ahead of earnings and then they beat and then it's like all right we already it already ran up so they run
51:26
up into it that's the whole like uh was it buy the room or sell the news that type of thing
51:31
oh wow so there's a big beat huh oh i like that now this is okay now we got uh i mean
51:37
who know non-gaap epsb probably gonna see this with gamestop everything just looking at it so much
51:43
with these videos um revenue down fifty percent euro
51:48
whoa 48.3
51:54
how can that be you're kidding me
52:01
48 percent
52:07
wow that is a big drop
52:12
i'm sure covered yeah including retail and also closing the cost account wow
52:21
okay gross margin what's up see look at that i like that i like that you know what i mean like
52:27
your revenues are collapsing before your eyes and they grew gross margin
52:35
not much but that's it they're making it's a statement
52:44
ah this looks interesting now we can wait too maybe it's not maybe it's not an imminent imminent buy or anything like that but
52:49
now we're in like all right what if it pulls back that's the thing and um it may pull back because the
52:54
whole market's pulling back you know what i mean and that's where you have these tremendous opportunities that's why it's important to always be doing this and then when you get something
52:59
like the kovid pull back earlier this year it's like you're ready to run um that's the thing so there's never any
53:05
real into this this tracking stuff
53:15
i guess i'd be a little bit curious about their outlook do they have an oh look balance sheet summary yup i agree that's
53:22
the summary total including 170 ml yeah okay that
53:27
for a second there was a revolver there i included the raw revolver and calculating my enterprise value for game stuff i feel like that
53:32
makes sense second call inventories at the end of the second quarter hey so they're okay
53:39
so they're getting cleaning out their inventories as well but not providing for your gut inside i
53:46
mean no surprise there currently anticipates the third quarter will decline in the range of 35 to 45 wow really big declines
53:52
oh and then the question is um where does it stop you know
53:59
and they do not have you know what i mean like this is why sorry i see a lot of analogies here at the gamestop this is why i keep on
54:05
bringing up gamestop but um it's um there's a lot of similarities here i mean these th this is these are
54:10
bigger drops than that and that's surprising to me but the backdrop for this company is not so
54:17
if i'm gonna now i'm gonna compare the two i mean gamestop you have a backdrop of thriving gaming and stuff like that plus there's a huge console there's a
54:24
union there's a major catalyst upcoming that will everyone agrees will boost the operating performance of
54:29
of gamestop and then it's just a question of for how long and all that but you don't get that with so many other retailers out there and
54:36
um and so when i see these numbers i'm much more concerned than the whatever it was 30 20 decline
54:42
in game stop um or whatever it was because it has um
54:47
it has a potential catalyst so here i have to say i'm a little bit more like shell shocked
54:56
do we have the fundamentals up let's just take a peek you'll see watch watch all this purple and green check this i always talk about the purple and
55:02
green right well there was purple and green all
55:07
right so that ended oh oh look at this no why is this quarterly let's go let me go i fixed it i fixed this last time
55:13
let's see if i can do it again why is it doing that domestic common um
55:23
i think i can do this right
55:33
sometimes it has the weird meta come on it has like a weird
55:41
meta category which throws off the report domestic comet is one that i don't have
55:50
did that not work
55:59
oh domestic common stock i had a feeling
56:06
boom got it let's go
56:15
there's two billion in revenues though huh kind of surprised two billion in revenues really big company for me
56:23
but rapidly declining huh 50 percent what a rough quarter i mean i
56:29
know all that's going on too but
56:35
tangible book four bucks that's the thing so it was trading at 75 percent of tangible book it looked much more compelling um
56:45
look at this it earned they've been there they bought not much so we can use this
56:51
they bought back a little bit of shares what just under 10 percent excuse me um just oh are they about ten
56:57
not a six all right so between ten and twenty percent um but look at this it was earned seven
57:02
dollar it was earning seven dollars per share you believe this
57:07
so i mean this is uh this is my type of company i know now this here's the here's the deep value investor coming out with me right i mean
57:13
look at this seven dollars you know what i mean like this is what i was seeing this was this is what we did during another stream
57:19
right let's look at the company right here it looks perfect and i blah blah blah pass the performance blah blah i get all that
57:25
but then we look at this see all this purple and green that looks good right strong equity growth but then you just look at the
57:32
sheer size of historical earnings and you see that they were earning six seven dollars and then it's trading at three
57:37
dollars you don't need much to go right you just need something to just change perceptions just a tad
57:43
and you can just run up that's what i mean now i there's secular there is clearly secular risk
57:48
you can't be down 40 year over year so there's real i mean we all can see what those risks are and they're legitimate but you can see how it could
57:55
also in theory be overblown it could be i'm not saying it definitely is but um but this this is the stuff that
58:01
sticks out to me and i i mean i see it with gamestop because we're making this comparison between the two but when you see
58:06
and i made it with fett too in that uh when i was comparing fvt like you just look at how much it earned that one year two year or three year average these
58:12
were all three year averages and there was a three year average from 2013 to 2015 or let's even go recent 2014 and 2016 world
58:18
five dollars per share in one year so so now it's it's clear what the um with the thesis is we just need to make sure
58:25
and maybe we won't maybe we'll fail but we just need to make sure there'll still be demand for these fossil watches looking out
58:31
three four five years maybe that's not the case i'm not saying that's the case but you can very clearly see what risks you have to um to parse
58:39
and when you see this historical performance and then with like an fet it's more they also have some debt that they need to
58:44
they deal with whereas fossil doesn't right they have enough cash to pay off all their debt and so forth um it's just not an imminent risk right
58:50
now this thing sorry about that um so now this is
58:56
looking kind of exciting to me right i mean i like it more three bucks i like it more three bucks and i wish i uh i wish i kind of pulled this up back
59:02
then and then if you look at the cash flow too i recall this look at the cash flow so you're looking at earnings and you're
59:07
probably going to see major write-downs and all that stuff right but if you look at just simple free cash flow and as a reminder oh i'm blocking it let me
59:13
switch um silver castle just uh this is good
59:19
because i think i mentioned this in one of those tweets it's just operating casual minus capex right basic and
59:25
true free casual analysis you need to adjust it and all that um but this is always a this is a great starting point and then you see even
59:32
right now it's still earned it was still generating simple free cash flow of two three bucks past couple years
59:38
um over the past three years three dollars and so this looks interesting to me and
59:44
i i feel like this is a classic deep value stock too so now you can just categorize me as like a
59:50
of what i like to see in stocks but um i mean i i
59:55
i don't know that cash flow same thing with net cash flow right even more well i'm kind of blocking a
1:00:03
little bit there net cash flow a little bit more conservative could takes operating cash flow subtracts everything in cash flow
1:00:08
in investing which could include acquisitions and stuff like that but even that's still two dollars i consider it a little bit more conservative in my mind
1:00:15
um but even that's two dollars all right let's pull up the cash flow statement i don't know about five bucks though
1:00:21
this looks super cheap what's the chart what did it do again
1:00:29
ah you could see see what i mean look how hot look it
1:00:34
went up to 25 bucks i forgot it was that i mean and then you can kind of even i'd agree with kind of forget about forget about these highs
1:00:40
but still some people are going to notice this type of stuff that's what i mean that's why i mentioned some technical analysis in that latest gamestop
1:00:46
video because i i mean i don't care so much about this but other people do
1:00:51
and if they if those people start piling on and they say this talk used to trade at 100 bucks per share i know it sounds ridiculous right i'm a value investor i
1:00:57
get that part but i'm just saying other people take note of this stuff uh and you are curious about what that
1:01:03
10-year high is or the five-year higher the 52-week high um and even in 20 less than two years
1:01:09
ago it was trading at over 20 bucks you know what i mean so that's what i mean it was more compelling at three bucks less so at five bucks get given that we
1:01:14
just saw 48 year-over-year but nevertheless um
1:01:19
let's pull up the cash cashflow statement super quick are here ah this is the thank you
1:01:30
oh you know what i also let's pull that up while we're here pull this up real quick just take a peek i've definitely done this before
1:01:36
now i'm surprised i don't know more fossil because i looked at fossil like before march and april and i thought it
1:01:42
was i thought it looked interesting i might have looked back i looked back no i didn't look back there i looked
1:01:47
here and i probably bought some and i got my ass kicked by it right because everything went down but i didn't buy as much more and it was
1:01:53
almost because it had such a strong balance sheet which is silly i know that but um
1:01:59
i felt the upside might be somewhat limited which as it turned out was at least partially true
1:02:04
all right let's check this oh good i'm on this side i'm not blocking all right let's just check so this is through 2019 we're missing
1:02:09
a really rough six months here right just just doing a quick check quick sanity check on this uh so you see
1:02:17
some kind of fat stock-based compensation right it's operating cash flow
1:02:24
yeah i mean that's well it's not that fat you see 30 20 million but operating cash flow is closer to like 200 million
1:02:29
and then you have how come it was down so much this year so they had to gain was it just working capital tax okay so accrued expenses that had a huge drop
1:02:36
this year these are always going to be lumpy right this is working capital some years are going to be it's always going to be lumpy that's why
1:02:42
i always got to take the average of these types of things because in one year like you just have this happen with gamestop
1:02:47
jesus how many tell me how many times can i make that let me take a drink it's just because it's a good comparison in this case
1:02:54
where they're trying to improve working capital management right so um they might be doing some moves on accounts receivables or paying off paying down
1:02:59
accounts payables or trying to get rid of inventory and so stuff starts moving around that's why it's very important it's
1:03:04
lumpy so you look at averages that's all uh so just when i see this you see this big outlay 150 but there was also a big
1:03:11
inflow 150 for inventories the year prior um so let's see the non-cash lease expense
1:03:17
anything sticking out here good look a huge goodwill impairment back in 2017. wow
1:03:23
and so they had a gain for the earnings right there not too much is sticking out to me all like boilerplate stuff remember the balance
1:03:30
sheet i like super simple financial statements and balance sheets super simple this cash flow statement looks pretty damn
1:03:36
simple too right you know what i mean you get some markdowns that's going to be expected in a retail environment the goodwill impairment that's going to
1:03:42
continue having non-cash restructuring bad debt expense and these are all these are all small you don't even need to care too much
1:03:48
about the small stuff right i mean if you're dealing in 200 million plus and operating cash flow i'm sorry but
1:03:54
three million it's not that big it's not a thesis change you can focus on the big the big fat items i don't even really care too much
1:03:59
about this uh this gain at this point in time so it's more this is more just some working capital type stuff that's
1:04:05
happening down here and then let me just check the sheer level of revenues i like to see that stuff just year over year revenues oh wow
1:04:13
that's not as much as i have wow it's a really bad year for them huh 48 year-over-year this isn't that rapid
1:04:19
this is big these are big declines but that's not rapid boy what a rough year huh
1:04:28
no one's why i mean no it's uh it's kind of a luxury a little bit i mean i know fossils not
1:04:33
crazy expensive or anything like that but who would buy a watch plus the competition but like smartwatch company and plus they do they have us
1:04:39
them i should know this i think they have smart watches they just tried to go down that path but this serious competition now where
1:04:45
their secondary secondary tertiary player at this point i feel confident about that although i'm not certain
1:04:51
but um how big is this drop sorry
1:04:58
get the graphic calculator all right 12 what did they sell that did they sell a
1:05:03
part of their business what's going on here where am i
1:05:09
was there's acid cell so i get this this column this row right uh
1:05:16
where the hell's that row even i can't find it retained earnings
1:05:24
right here no wow that's that is a such a rapid so i've been like
1:05:31
as you've been looking at how companies have been performing in q2 right i've been trying to take note of which ones really are getting pummeled
1:05:36
by the current environment and um this is one more
1:05:42
if you have other examples please oh so oh sorry someone commented my bad i was it was getting blocked by my damn
1:05:47
thing there gme normalized free cash flow for 2021 oh well oh i'm on oh i'm sorry i thought it was gonna be able to fall so what
1:05:53
type of game stop good question um normalize free cash flow for 2021 so that's a good question
1:05:59
i guess we'll do a quick i mean i got a comment here i got a question let's roll with it how long how long ago did you ask i don't know oh it doesn't tell me the
1:06:05
time but um somewhat related i'm doing so many damn comparisons to um to to to gamestop here so off the top of
1:06:12
my head i i don't know if the top of my head my big thesis a big part of my thesis with gamestop is
1:06:17
it's going to be what do you say 2021 so not this year but next year it's going to be at least a couple of 100 million that's that's my that's my
1:06:23
that's that's what i'm thinking and i even think that they'll be um i think there's a great chance to pause
1:06:29
generate positive free cash flow over the full 12 months for this year i think that's conceivable especially with the asset sales remember the asset sales
1:06:35
with the sale lease back that they're doing that's going to generate real cash and i think that's the big asset sale you know
1:06:40
what i mean but um but if you're talking strictly operations which is really important right if you're trying to estimate the value
1:06:46
of the business itself it's the operational cash flow that you'd be curious about but um this is the thing with the 300
1:06:51
million dollar market cap in all this cash they have in the books really if they can just generate three four five six hundred million in
1:06:57
free cash flow over the next couple years it's super super cheap relative to that now on a straight 12 month basis
1:07:03
um i mean i i could totally see them generating upwards of like 300 400 million
1:07:11
in a 12 month period i'm not saying that's my base case or anything like that but it almost seems like people have completely written that off as if it's
1:07:17
not possible but that seems nuts to me because uh because of the cost uh because of the
1:07:22
rating and the cost that they've been doing over the past 12 months related to gross margin and related to sg a this stuff is they've been doing this
1:07:28
for the past 18 months right the new management team forget about the old management team forget about the that they did but
1:07:34
um this new management team's actually been making decisions improving working capital management they're doing all these small things de-densifying the
1:07:39
stores blah blah blah you know all this right you know all these things now they're going to come to fruition right at the time that these consoles
1:07:45
are going to be released it's it's true it really is conceivable oh i have it up here sir i get the fundamentals up i'm sorry
1:07:52
if people dialed into um fossil but we got a legit question on on gamestop here so we gotta roll with it
1:07:58
um um sorry what was i just gonna pull up oh just the just the
1:08:04
the cost management here i was gonna pull up is this game stop through may yeah yeah yeah so we got we
1:08:10
saw gross margin increase like gross margin is already increasing despite that huge revenue sell-off this year
1:08:15
it's just crazy and sga is still inflated i know a lot of people point that out even i pointed this out in one of my videos
1:08:21
if you look at sg a margin right here you can see this right let me highlight the row it still looks it still looks fat 32
1:08:29
big part of the reason is because of the revenues are coming back down and they're still in the process of winding down their stores and i always i'm also
1:08:35
curious too i don't know if you have an opinion on this but like does it make sense to keep these stores open a little bit longer
1:08:40
because of the new consoles are coming out i don't have a strong opinion on that it's just something i've been kind of thinking about let me
1:08:46
flip back it's been something i've been thinking about um it doesn't it doesn't matter but it's just these are the types of things they're thinking about right
1:08:51
now whereas the past management wasn't and so my point just being if people are looking back at historical free cash flow margins of like something
1:08:57
like um i did this in one of the videos um at what it was generating back in the day
1:09:02
of uh like and i know this is through what is this wait a second wait a second
1:09:10
oh i get the same oh did sorry this date is inaccurate look at this so we get the same issue here
1:09:15
that we had just had for um hold on let me just fix this real quick ah did they change their thing i need to
1:09:21
do the same thing sorry about this
1:09:30
watch this same issue
1:09:38
that'll fix it okay um sorry i was looking real messy it was
1:09:44
just throwing me for a loop that was even a lot of red for me you know what i mean but um we go back to so i would say
1:09:50
saying 32 right but um for sg a so it is 32 percent but look at the it look you see a huge leap up right
1:09:56
here right that's what some people are paying attention to but i think that i think this is like a little bit deceiving because we know
1:10:01
that they've been taking action we know that revenues are gonna i mean hopefully most people would agree with this revenue is gonna jump quite a
1:10:06
bit next year and so this is what i'm getting at they're reigning in a lot of these costs and they've had about
1:10:11
a solid it's gonna turn out to be 18 months which isn't that long really it could take two years three years to
1:10:16
really get it but that's okay um and so this is going to increase what historical i don't know if it will increase but you
1:10:22
see what these historical free casual margins were back in the day simple for casual right operating casual less capex
1:10:29
we're looking at like five six percent right and so now people go well they're not going to generate any free cash flow but i'm really not so sure i think when you
1:10:35
get this big revenue jump up maybe you don't get back to eight billion nine billion or something like that but if you stabilize it like six seven billion
1:10:41
and you can even get a fraction of this i'm talking one percent two percent count calculate that out times um
1:10:48
0.02 percent then you're at 120 million so at just what does that say two percent of six billion they're at six
1:10:53
billion right now there's six billion in revenues so then you get to seven billion in revenues and you're still at two percent
1:10:59
or what if these costs uh raining in these costs can i mean can you imagine if they get five
1:11:06
percent in simple free cash flow margin um then forget it and then there's the balance sheet you know what i mean so
1:11:11
there's just so much downside that this is just the the asymmetric upside looks compelling but for the actual precise 2021 i don't
1:11:19
know i would say oh are you going to pin me on this you just ask a question i want to pin myself
1:11:25
on this you know what i mean but really i can't do anything but give you a range i would say if i had and i don't want to be too
1:11:31
aggressive i think i would say between
1:11:37
i would say between 200 and 500 million i would put it up there yeah i i really can envision 500 million in
1:11:43
free cash flow um and i assume you mean for the fiscal year 2021. so what's that january through next year
1:11:50
yeah and can you imagine 500 million for one year of free cash flow plus book value and all that this is why i'm so bullish on gamestop
1:11:56
because i have what maybe other people will consider i don't want to say delusional estimates of free cash flow but they're really not
1:12:01
that they're really not that aggressively bullish for my and even at 200 million i mean even at 200 million
1:12:06
in free cash flow um and remember the reduced share count then you're still looking at what is that a buck or two and free cash flow on
1:12:13
a share price of four bucks or whatever it is then it's a question of how long can they extend that
1:12:18
which is a fair question but this is the thing that's just the downside and then if they ever successfully
1:12:23
if they ever successful what if they use this console so this that's like my base case i consider that a base case
1:12:29
um but can you imagine this is why i try to make this i try to talk about this prominently in the videos can you imagine if they do transform themselves
1:12:36
everyone says it's a zero percent ever zero percent chance they transform themselves right zero percent zero percent would you
1:12:43
haven't you seen enough in the market why would you put zero percent on anything i wouldn't put zero percent on anything the market has like priced in like
1:12:49
negative negative percent chance that this can happen can you imagine if they use this the release of these consoles
1:12:54
to like have like a more experiential type thing these next few months in october november december even the next
1:13:00
six months of the first six months of 2021 were people like coming in and playing games i would say that i wish we had heard
1:13:06
more about this now it's august but me this i mean maybe we're going to get some some some continual bullish news on on that
1:13:12
front over the next coming months with some vendor partnerships where maybe there's going to be exclusive
1:13:17
testing out of games or whatever it is within the stores i'm not saying that's going to happen you know what i mean but i can at least envision this stuff
1:13:23
and that's what i i try to say in the video like can't you you can't envision this stuff so if they ever did succeed and it's not
1:13:30
just a question of what terminal value is within a because everyone says they're going to generate what's your estimate for free cash that's what
1:13:36
everyone said what's your free cash flow forecast looking at a couple years and then that's it that's the end of the discussion because people say well that's all they have left
1:13:42
and then if they as long as they distribute it to shareholders and don't do any stupid acquisitions right blah blah blah that's not
1:13:47
i don't mean that's a ridiculous thing to say but that's often the end of the discussion and that's a mistake when you're looking for asymmetric upside
1:13:53
because it's just such a thriving industry you at least need to entertain the possibility that they pull something off here with
1:13:59
reggie on the board of this i just think oh my god zero percent zero percent so when i see
1:14:04
something like that i get really excited because even if it's 20 chance they pull that
1:14:09
off then you could it's conceivable that maybe gamestop doesn't get back to
1:14:15
eight nine ten billion and that's what they that's their long-term future but if they can stabilize at six billion or
1:14:21
seven billion and they become the go-to spot for gaming experiences and then people even start to like gamestop
1:14:27
because they're sponsoring their local um just gaming environment you know what i mean i'm not saying that's going to
1:14:33
happen but it's it's at least possible and if that happens just forget about it because if you change that if you change the um
1:14:42
the uh well first of all the discount rate right everyone's using super high discount rates even myself but if you change that terminal value and you say
1:14:48
it can grow alongside the gaming industry which is crushing it by way the gaming industry you see how fast it's growing people
1:14:54
and they're saying it's going to be like 200 billion within um within a couple like 2023 i think is the
1:14:59
forecast 200 billion in gaming it's like gamestop can't carve out a small percentage of that they can't carve out
1:15:04
what do you say they can't cover 2 of that that's 4 billion in revenues
1:15:10
and especially if there's some high margin stuff in there i just think the yeah it's just tremendous the
1:15:16
potential upside and then there's just a question of the what's the probable upside and blah blah blah and then we
1:15:21
start talking down but when i think of this for when you hear my free cash flow forecast and i'm thinking like it could be could be 200
1:15:27
million i mean people talk about bankruptcy like that's ridiculous if you have lower free cash flow
1:15:33
forecast for 2021 like i'm curious about i really want to hear that because i want to hear the assumptions that go into that
1:15:38
um like do you really don't think revenues are going to be so it's just a huge drop look at this they had 8 billion in
1:15:44
revenues through may 2019 8 billion um is it that crazy to think they're going to bounce back to 7 billion or to
1:15:51
eight billion in revenues i don't really know but if if they do and these costs have been stabilized then that
1:15:57
i don't know 200 million but anyway i want to see if someone goes they're not going to make 200 million they're not going to make zero i need to see your
1:16:03
assumptions what are your revenue assumptions what are your gross margin assumptions and what are your simple free
1:16:08
i guess that's it i need like three days i need like three data points to see if you're just you're just bullshitting me based on the
1:16:15
secular con risks or if you've actually penciled through the numbers because i'm sure there's plenty of bright people out there maybe even smarter than me
1:16:22
penciled their numbers like nothing i don't know about that uh i need to see i gotta see i gotta say
1:16:27
but um so anyway i hope that hey that was a good little just game stop just get if you've got any other game stop discussions let's talk
1:16:33
about it because i mentioned i added it today so maybe i'll catch myself in a blunder i'd be like oh
1:16:38
maybe i shouldn't have added today but um yeah 2022 2022 gets a
1:16:44
little bit more insert now i'm just thinking out loud now of course 2020 is uncertain too but 2020
1:16:49
that if they generate 50 or 100 million in some assets you know i don't know about 100 million maybe 50 million
1:16:56
um that's that that will that will cover the cash burn if they have i assume they're gonna even maybe even have a cash burn this quarter
1:17:01
too but q force would be great and that's when they generate the bulk of their free cash flow and uh but 2022
1:17:07
that's tougher i'd i'd skew lower but who knows that they'll be i don't know it's just so many damn
1:17:12
games did you see this i think over 40 games coming out alongside these consoles
1:17:18
i mean that's twice as much as they had at the last console cycle and i'd be curious in your opinion on this too my take talking to family and friends
1:17:25
and seeing the headlines out there is that i don't this i don't think these consoles are
1:17:30
necessarily revolution or anything like that but wasn't isn't it isn't there more excitement this could
1:17:37
be confirmation by let me just talk about i feel like there's a little bit more excitement about these consoles because xbox one and ps4 maybe it's because xbox 360
1:17:46
and um and ps3 were just so hyped up you know what i mean they're some of the top selling consoles of all time
1:17:52
and um and like they were just they're terrific right and um and then it's like xbox one and
1:17:58
ps4 yeah ps4 that all right yeah okay okay and now but do you see some of the graphics on some of these new ones too
1:18:03
and i don't know this is just opinion that the thesis isn't pinned on or anything like that but i think this scene this seems sick doesn't it
1:18:10
doesn't it seem like this is gonna be great and then everyone's there's they announced it earlier and then there's gonna be all these games coming out with it i could see there being more
1:18:16
excitement around this and getting people energized about it but um so i don't know but i wouldn't
1:18:22
say that it's gonna be bigger than the other consoles but i don't know it makes me think that the free cash flow could
1:18:27
extend for a couple of years and again that's really just we're just that's supporting the downside and then
1:18:33
i just think all right so i feel i feel super covered on the downside and then i'm much more curious about the
1:18:39
debates about what that upside is um and the the arguments against that are are better i feel the arguments
1:18:45
against the downside i feel kind of silly okay now i need a drink but um that's why i'm always i'm curious
1:18:50
about people's numbers anyway we should be getting some some
1:18:55
news soon so we'll see and i'll be curious what this updated book value is it looks like they sold those those um
1:19:02
those those warehouses and distribution centers based on you see those online listings and stuff
1:19:08
it looks like they've already been transferred who is it to brookfield or something um it looks like there anyway i don't it
1:19:13
doesn't show the dollar amount or anything like that but we'll get that i mean we could get that before earnings but regardless
1:19:19
it could be a higher but could be dealing with a higher book value um because they might net a gain on that
1:19:26
as well and then and that would be cash and then yeah i don't know all right okay
1:19:34
um anything is anything stand sometimes sometimes i'll look at a company right and i'll take a break and maybe i leave
1:19:41
i just go somewhere and then i come back and then something else catches my attention or so a new thing lit up that i didn't see before
1:19:47
and now i've looked at this stamp now i've looked at this damn sheet so much hey christian cheers mate thanks a lot uh
1:19:54
that i don't think anything really sticks out to me but i guess the the you imagine the
1:20:01
shirt what they bought back or they bought back more on uh i don't think they will they get 100
1:20:06
million left oh i meant to include that in the video and i forgot to maybe i mentioned it i forget they still
1:20:13
have 100 million in authorization they could take the proceeds from the sale lease back and buy back the 100
1:20:18
now it doesn't say i don't know can you imagine going into the console refresh with 40 million share oh now at this
1:20:24
point the price is getting bit up right how much could they actually buy back they got 120 i think left wow
1:20:31
that'd be sick i haven't seen enough volume have you seen enough volume on this
1:20:36
i was watching this for a while like in um
1:20:44
it was 10 million on friday right i mean and clearly that was because the gamestop video was released by
1:20:50
roaring kitty right um but like that's a lot of volume for a random ass friday right
1:20:56
um but everything else has been really quiet you know what i mean and since then you had a big update on
1:21:02
august um but really not much so plus what's the sentiment if you read through their
1:21:08
presentation sorry now this is a figure that just caught my that's what i'm talking about then i started thinking through um
1:21:16
if you look at their presentations management sentiment is really like they're done with the share buybacks and stuff and i know heston permanent got on
1:21:21
the board and stuff but i don't think that's gonna make much of a difference but at the same time that i'm throwing
1:21:26
off because you see how much they bought see how much they bought last year q4 was it like september october november i was
1:21:33
surprised i support i even thought back then that they were doing the right thing if you remember too the conference call i've said this a
1:21:40
number of times in the stream now but it still kind of confuses the confuses the hell out of me they announced on that conference call back
1:21:46
in may or june or whatever the hell it was 2019. they were like we're not doing we're not doing any buybacks or something then like three days later they did the dutch auction like
1:21:52
what the hell that's what i mean i i think management has been doing a lot of the right stuff over the past year and stuff but then i think but then
1:21:58
i think some stuff confuses the hell out of me and they were like we're not doing any i could have sworn i should pull up the conference call or maybe you remember
1:22:05
but um they said what are twenty buybacks and then the stock price collapsed and they cut the dividend and blah blah blah and then they did the tender off well
1:22:11
why why'd they even do the tender why'd you do the 10 why'd you do the dutch auction excuse me like buy it back in the open market so
1:22:17
first they so it was real messy then i was like i haven't had as heavy a position
1:22:22
as i do right now back then because i was right when they didn't when they announced they weren't going to do buybacks i may have just dabbled but i'm like oh
1:22:28
if you're not doing buybacks i'm not interested like you have to do the buybacks and i and then i i know heston berman had
1:22:34
written some letters prior to that and then barry wrote his letter after that and they were right you need to do some of the buybacks um
1:22:41
and so then they changed to and they did the buybacks but they did the dutch auction which was super weird i still don't understand the dutch auction
1:22:46
if someone can get some clarity on that i'd be super curious um and then and then and then they
1:22:52
didn't buy back after that like i was like oh maybe they're going to keep on buying up maybe they and then barry wrote his letter i'm like all right maybe they're going to
1:22:58
listen maybe they're actually going to take some action here this could be sick then it could be it could truly be exploit which this
1:23:03
that was crazy this was a year ago what's the date it was a year ago today wasn't it i remember being excited that barry
1:23:09
wrote that letter because uh i had been building i had been once they announced the dutch auction i had been building a position
1:23:15
in gamestop and then he announced that i'm like all right i'm not totally i'm not totally crazy here and then i'm like all right maybe um
1:23:22
they're gonna start buying back and then they announced uh q2 results in mid-september they hadn't bought back and i'm like what the
1:23:27
whoa oh how did you not i did you not buy back and then uh but then they said some
1:23:33
things i'm like on the conference call all right maybe that's the thing you read these conference calls when you're i'm not always reading the conference
1:23:38
calls right but if i'm heavily dialed into a position and you really care about what's going on if you have a super concentrated portfolio which i
1:23:45
sometimes have not right now excuse me except for gamestop
1:23:50
i'm reading i'm reading any anything that it's published on the internet i'm reading i don't care where it was posted if it's
1:23:56
publicly available i read it um and um and so i'm reading the
1:24:01
conference call trying to parse like their sentiment stuff like that are they going to take action they got to do that and then i i try not to place too much confidence in
1:24:07
that right but i'm still i'm doing it and then um and then i'm like i don't
1:24:12
know if that i remember going into the q3 in december i'm like i don't know what they're going to do i i really can't get a finger get take
1:24:18
the pulse off and then they bought back a done it was a terrible quarter it was like a worse quarter than
1:24:23
everyone's expecting i think myself included but they bought back a ton would they buy back 20 million or something and i was like holy
1:24:30
then i got super bullish then i'm like all right now because at the time would the price do we'll
1:24:36
come back to you fossil we'll come back i don't know how much more there is to talk about it because i need i need to dig into it
1:24:42
sorry i gotta check this real quick it sold off right it sold off was that
1:24:48
six bucks still but i was getting really but here we are it's august it's below us and uh we're not even right at that
1:24:57
level yet huh then i was like oh i'm getting bullish now because uh even i'm getting really bullish because
1:25:02
holy management is aligned with us first they said no buybacks then they did the stupid ass
1:25:08
ducks auction and then barry wrote his letter and they weren't they didn't seem to be doing anything i know there was like quiet periods and stuff blackout
1:25:14
periods and like that and so there's probably some truth to that but then i remember reading the comments i'm like i don't know uh they said some
1:25:20
things that i'm like all right all right they kind of i couldn't i wasn't confident but then they did that and i'm like
1:25:26
i care more about the actions just like when you're watching this stream too what i would when i actually do
1:25:31
something like i'll take a lot of notes and i'll say a lot of stuff and i do this to myself too where i'll think something or i'll do something if
1:25:36
i actually do it it holds more weight with me this is why it's important to take notes and tag stuff because if i tag it or if
1:25:42
i do it it means like i i weighed the decision i thought about anyway when games have actually bought all those shares my all
1:25:47
right they were aligned we're aligned they're on board they seem to be doing a good job cutting costs they're saying the right stuff
1:25:53
let's do it and then um and then the code would happen right and then it's uh
1:26:01
which which it interferes with their social plans right i mean there's no
1:26:06
denying that we talk about the upside right let's talk about how um social distancing can impact a company that's trying to become a social
1:26:12
blah blah blah that's not lost i mean that's that's real but um and then um and then so then i've
1:26:17
been reading closely following then they they stop buying back shares they haven't bought they bought back a nominal amount in q1 then they didn't
1:26:24
buy any and like as it turned out though i i regret they were right i thought they when they
1:26:31
announced in in january they did that uh holiday results or whatever and then they didn't not that they needed town
1:26:37
down to any then they announced in march and that was like then all this happened right i was really happy they didn't buy back showers i would have been
1:26:42
hester and permit i don't know about barry but like we would have been the thesis might not have failed per se
1:26:49
but would have been much riskier and one of it and here we are the price is still lower right but we the backs the gamestop
1:26:54
management kind of mentioned this in their presentation it would have been a tougher environment right now but when i when they announced
1:27:00
in march and they said they didn't buy back shares i have to say i was a little bit relieved just because i at the time too this was march was it 26
1:27:06
27 who the hell knows what was ahead i mean you're literally your stores are literally closed and i'm like
1:27:12
i'm sure glad we get the cash on the books right now because if they had exhausted that extra 100 million
1:27:18
it could have been it would have been tough it was only 100 million that's remaining though that's the thing and so but even still all sequel i'm like i'm glad we got that
1:27:24
100 million right now um and then we'll figure it out after we as in like i'm part of the board from
1:27:30
what the hell um and uh and so that was march and then they
1:27:36
announced when they announced it in june they didn't buy back any but then i was really starting to like they're probably not gonna i was really starting to pick up on the
1:27:42
sentiment they had that presentation that gamestop present presentation that i referenced in the latest video um
1:27:48
where they like we're done they made it something like we completed the share buybacks when clearly the authorization wasn't exhausted but maybe in their
1:27:54
minds they were completed so i've been kind of getting on this like we're not doing we're focused on the bonds they said that in q12 are focused on the bonds
1:28:01
and um but now the bonds are behind them you know what i mean like they've they've successfully refinanced uh to a
1:28:08
degree right they did that exchange it was a success as far as i'm concerned it was it's borderline a resounding
1:28:13
success i'm not totally sure if it could have been if it maybe it would have been better if they all exchanged i'm not sure it's like
1:28:19
i'm not a bond expert not a credit expert per se but from my perspective they got rid of those covenants and top notch and
1:28:26
then they have enough cash plenty of cash to pay off the 2021 debt and um excuse me but then they extended
1:28:34
the other debt so i feel as though they're in a great position where now it's like 100 million now they've they forecasted liquidity of the
1:28:40
forecast liquidity of 565.70 they still get the revolver that maybe will be paid down by now was at 130 or
1:28:46
some 135 but um and then you get so then i have no idea how this tangent started
1:28:52
but um then you get so they forecasted 565.70 and then uh that guy adjusted on seeking office that
1:28:58
he reached out to the board and they said um that wasn't including any proceeds from the sale lease back so
1:29:04
that in theory that could be an extra anywhere from 30 40 million to 100 million i have no idea it sounds like they're really high
1:29:09
quality assets though you they they may have had enough from the sale of proceeds themselves to go
1:29:15
buy back to go exhaust the authorization so that's what i mean so now i'm trying to think about i feel as though they have the financial situation and we're
1:29:20
close enough to the consoles where they could pull the trigger on it um and but now i'm not sure
1:29:26
if the sentiment is there anymore maybe with the debt behind them and it's if they did go aggressive that q3
1:29:32
if they hadn't got aggressive this would be a different story but they did go super aggressive that q3 and they said on that conference call now
1:29:38
i'm thinking off the top of my head i think he said something i remember i was listening to it i was listening to
1:29:43
it in my car actually uh and can you believe that i was listening to the damn conversations i
1:29:48
was like i was really like all right let me let me let me tune in for how ridiculous is that right nerdal art and uh and he said something like
1:29:54
someone someone asked a question i've since read it in the transcript and stuff but someone asked a question like hey what
1:29:59
are you doing buying back all those shares what do you know i'm buying back all those shares like what the hell are you doing that was the gist of it and the
1:30:06
and uh i think what sherman was sure was like sherman's like um like we know what we're doing almost
1:30:11
like we know we're the sharepoint we know where we're going to be trading a year from now we said something like that which i thought was like
1:30:16
geez even i don't i don't know if i'd say that i don't know if i'd say that in the conference call but i was like kind of surprised
1:30:22
a little bit surprised he he framed it like that like we know where we're going to be trading a year from now we're not crazy we know what we're dealing with and i thought
1:30:27
and i thought hey cheers to george sherman because that's what i thought too
1:30:33
and it means a lot for them to take action to buy it and to say it on the conference call now since then they've truly dialed it back quite a bit where
1:30:38
i'm kind of like all right we'll see but because they've been doing a lot of the other right stuff and then you saw bari supported them on um i saw we're
1:30:46
looking at the chart here i should have this up i've already supported them too and i agree with this i i agree with
1:30:52
they've been doing a lot of the right enough for the right things where it's not a big deal for me whether or not uh hester and permit um
1:30:57
get those board seats especially because it's just a couple of board seats and they did so much up to that point where i'm lying it's okay they're doing a good job in
1:31:03
the cost management front but um but but now now i'm back to the capital
1:31:09
allocation standpoint where i'm like well what are you going to do now what are you going to do and also we haven't heard many material
1:31:15
announcements on this transformation front it's been it's been very quiet very bond focus for better for worse i think for better
1:31:21
i think it might be deliberate um like let's focus on the bonds and we'll get to let's get this final we could be a
1:31:27
questionable quarter behind us and let's start moving forward so um but anyway bear that in mind if
1:31:32
they go in if they go into october november december or they come out with 40 million shares and they can buy them back any time but
1:31:38
they're likely going to generate a ton of free cash flow over the next six months and you see the balance sheet as it
1:31:43
currently is we'll get an updated one in a couple of weeks but that type of setup and this is the thing this is that
1:31:50
uh the share price this is the thing this is what this is what probably irritates a lot of investors is you are not guaranteed to have this
1:31:58
you can't like you you're not guaranteed to be able to buy back five forever maybe i mean so far it looks like i've
1:32:04
been wrong right i mean that we're still trading below five in august 2020 i look like an idiot so
1:32:10
that's right so there at least there's at least some um some there's a case to be made there but
1:32:16
um like i think if you once once you you're taking care of the bonds
1:32:21
and as long as your liquidity situation is good and you're really close to the consoles like and the price is still below five you gotta do it do it now do it now or
1:32:28
or what do you that's the thing i feel like it's gonna be a busy next couple of months and if so
1:32:34
um and i feel the next i feel like the next move is the next 50 move is up and then it's
1:32:39
like if you hope you're doing it or you're gonna do it i just hope the opportunity you only the opportunity is limited
1:32:45
and i hope they don't lose it but um yeah we'll see i don't know there's so much there's so many
1:32:51
nuances here i uh and there's a lot to be wrong about there's a lot to be right about it's it's really it's a great battleground
1:32:57
stock right that's why it's why it's a big position in the portfolio that's why i've been focusing a lot of hopefully you can tell right i mean i got so many
1:33:03
other damn positions and gamestop is now the biggest one blah blah blah but um it just
1:33:09
it's uh it's just fascinating it's fast let's see what happens i i certainly hope it works out because i don't you don't feel so crazy about
1:33:15
everything but um yeah we'll see but anyway can you imagine i mean i would i say 200 to 5
1:33:21
million i just pulled that on my ass by the way i haven't picked through like precise forecasters that's not my style
1:33:26
you'll get this um but i'd say that's i feel like that's roughly about 500 sounds a little bit high but i don't
1:33:33
know i they could kick ass um that's what i mean i like to leave a little bit of
1:33:38
opportunity on the upside but anyway let's use 200 200 i feel if they if they didn't
1:33:43
generate free cash flow of 200 million in fiscal year 2020 i would feel as though i messed up that like that's how
1:33:49
i feel um but um so let's use 200 million
1:33:57
so that's what i'm talking about let's say they get 200 million right if they get down to 40 million and 40 million shares that's five dollars
1:34:04
that's five dollars that's five dollars of free cash flow in one 12-month period you know what i mean and then you get like could could
1:34:10
could that persist for a couple more years and then uh and then the upside if they can successfully transform like what the
1:34:16
hell you know what i mean like ah um and so
1:34:21
those are the things that's um that that go through my mind and so you ask a good question that's such a pertinent
1:34:27
relevant question but there's all these other variables that kind of weigh on me but like but what if they do this what if they do that what if they
1:34:32
successfully transform what if um uh what if i mean i don't i don't know about selling game informer i
1:34:38
also don't know how much they'd actually get but you know what i mean then they raise cash all these other ways and this is where security analysis differs so many people out there when it
1:34:44
comes to gamestop they're doing bus they're doing like like business analysis and because
1:34:50
they're like like everyone knows the secular risks but like security analysis is different like we're trying to figure out
1:34:55
what that what this stock is worth you know what i mean when you're when you're dealing with the security itself
1:35:00
like the share of purchase capital allocation weighs in on it and then um [Music]
1:35:06
business decisions i don't know everyone just kind of writes it off they just kind of accept that the the past three or four years is representative i feel
1:35:11
like they're making they may be making a mistake you know what i mean like i pull up these historical fundamentals and i go
1:35:16
past performance isn't indicative of future performance blah blah blah but i feel like some of the bears might be making the same mistake where they see
1:35:22
they see this revenue trend and the free cash flow 10 in the chart and they think ah this is going to continue and i think
1:35:28
maybe you're right i'm not saying you're definitely wrong but i think this is one of those cases where the chart this really ugly oh this is
1:35:36
dividend adjusted where this is misrepresenting what's unfolding
1:35:41
underneath and i think i think people i don't know i
1:35:46
i don't know i don't know i don't know what to say maybe i'm wrong maybe i don't know i
1:35:53
like having company with barry though and it's i don't think we're wrong so that's the
1:36:00
thing i'm never too afraid about being wrong about something tonight it would make my analysis look bad i mean those were the first couple of
1:36:06
videos i rolled out right now it's biggest position blah blah blah but i'm wrong so much you know being wrong is part of
1:36:11
part of the game but in this particular case would be it's always an opportunity for education right that's a big part of the stream a big part of my positions
1:36:17
generally i always feel as though yeah i might get my ass kicked on something but i'm learning along the way
1:36:23
and um i say in one of my videos to me or five years from now it's going to look back on what i'm doing right now
1:36:28
and be like what the hell is that but that's a good thing right you should feel the same way it's like that's growth you know what i mean
1:36:34
that's growth so i mean i have like high conviction things but um that i could be wrong it's not lost it would just be
1:36:39
hugely educational for me this would be a this would be a big educational lesson if i were totally wrong i don't mind
1:36:46
being wrong about major upside or anything like that like some people talk about it going to like
1:36:53
i mean that's the thing if some people talk about like going back to like 40 and 50 bucks now on a perch on a on a market cap basis what's that is
1:37:00
that three billion it's not crazy if you saw in the video i made i made sure to make this clear that
1:37:05
like the max market cap back here was um oh i forgot what was it six billion
1:37:11
six billion market cap or something but with the share count that could be halved right um then if we got to the same share
1:37:17
price it's only half that right obviously but uh even i i mean i don't have much conviction
1:37:22
i talk about the possibility for transformation i'm just trying to do weighted average possibilities right weighted average probabilities weighted
1:37:27
average outcomes and like i don't you can't assign a zero percent of that you can't you can't you don't need to i'm not assigned a 50 chances and i'm
1:37:33
not assigning a 40 chance to own but maybe in the 10 to 30 percent maybe 30
1:37:38
i don't know maybe maybe 10 to 35 chance just because gaming is so kick ass and they're really the only major
1:37:44
retailer dedicated to it um that um i don't know it's definitely
1:37:50
possible so anyway uh this time but so i i wouldn't feel bad if it doesn't get to here but i i'd feel kind
1:37:55
of surprised we don't get back to 10 to 15. i definitely messed up something all right i overestimated certain things or
1:38:00
i underweighted certain things like i do that all the time you're going to see me make mistakes so far everything's been working out of my favors for the
1:38:06
past for the past five months or so um but um yeah we'll see this is looking good
1:38:12
though huh see let's don't talk about it sometimes it's usually fundamental but even the chart if i may try to include it in uh in that
1:38:18
video was this monthly this is kind of bullish right boy it's
1:38:23
not bullish it's not bullish it's just not as bearish you see the rsi getting out from oversold range and uh
1:38:30
it's not it's not bullish but in this chart isn't bullish although it's it's doing a base this is what the books say right i'm a deep value
1:38:35
investor i've been trying to get into charts like the past uh i don't know year 18 months or something
1:38:42
like that so you what you're seeing what you see me do here i'm just like i guess i don't know so i'm not kidding when i say what do
1:38:47
you say but i feel like uh people stop here which is an edge for i feel for value investors i think it's so
1:38:53
helpful to use both because it does seem like there's something here and it's a good manifestation of psychology and the
1:38:59
fundamentals unfolding i see it i see it kind of be useful over and over again so i use it as a supplemental tool
1:39:04
as part of my fundamental clearly it's fundamental analysis clearly it's fundamental analysis so i
1:39:10
spend a lot of time in this stream like looking at charts and and i'm like i hope it's clear that i care about the fundamentals
1:39:15
but um um okay so that's like can i pull up weekly here i've been doing this every
1:39:21
i did i was doing this because for the video okay see we're over 50 on the rsi here but it's not bullish per se but this is
1:39:28
the trend is looking up that's what i'd say i'm not this isn't bullish look at this it was hugely oversold last year right crazy oversold on a weekly basis
1:39:34
but then it never even got oversold in march which is everything was oversold in march and april wasn't it
1:39:40
um and um and then it never even got close this past well this is why i was buying i was buying
1:39:45
quite a bit and i mentioned this on the stream right right i bought quite a bit right now i'm like oh this looks this looks
1:39:50
great by below four i was buying a ton below four i've been already had a ton right relative to the existing position
1:39:58
and um it's turning out it's as it turned out right now right six months maybe i look like an idiot but i say that all the time
1:40:05
but um this still looks really good right now right um and then on the daily how about the daily
1:40:14
right this is when things going crazy this looks so look at this i do this sometimes too i
1:40:21
see some technical analysts like joe try these lines right there on the rsi like what i guess
1:40:27
is that a thing like can you do this can you do technical analysis on the art people do it people do it i i hope you don't think
1:40:32
i'm mocking you but i have no insight i mean i do this i'm saying i do it now but i'm like like conviction-wise i don't know i
1:40:40
don't know that'll do it but i see this it's not getting sold over much and so much has happened
1:40:45
here right look look this was on the daily it never got oversold it got oversold in um
1:40:50
in early 2020 and i was buying as it turned out it i thought and then i'm like oh i was buying too early it turned out i didn't i wasn't buying that
1:40:56
early because it held up really well in march and april like relatively it was crushing it was crushing all the
1:41:02
other positions and then it got sold off briefly here but this is almost i'm almost willing to overlook this
1:41:07
um not overlook it you know what i mean but you see the rsi like it didn't hold up and so look at this this has to be one of the
1:41:13
few stocks this has to be one of the few stocks that didn't get over so that wasn't the most oversold in march
1:41:19
and april that it was actually up there can't be that many stocks like this right
1:41:25
maybe uh help maybe some healthcare stocks were kicking ass or something like that
1:41:30
now you got me thinking now you got me thinking
1:41:35
it doesn't matter what does it matter no assistant so it's so i bought today right i still feel though this is a good
1:41:41
setup i feel as though um set up now i sound like a trader right
1:41:46
um that um i mean obviously the fun we haven't gotten news right so this is one thing i like to buy when
1:41:52
there's no news and like the stock not just gamestop any stock it's just tracking the market and it's kind of just like there's no
1:41:59
news everyone's like well i don't know what to do with this and then the market will sell off and it kind of just does nothing and everyone's just bored with it like this this is a classic
1:42:06
roaring kitty buy right here like oh this is great um and now no news is out now it's up it's almost up almost damn 20
1:42:13
um but now i feel as though now we're getting so close like news could be imminent and um
1:42:19
we're just getting so close i feel like i'm running out of time i can't how much more can i add to it i really can't plus
1:42:24
the options forget about the options now i mean i i have options but um they're just
1:42:30
they're in the stratosphere i mean i they're just so damn expensive they're so expensive you got the vix at 22. i
1:42:35
talked about that right and uh and um ah they're just so expensive now
1:42:41
and i can't see anything i can't see anything super compelling and i'm super bullish on gamestop but i'm just like ah
1:42:46
i mean i'm glad i got the ones i said this for a number of positions for a lot of my options but i'm like i'm glad i got the ones that i
1:42:52
do but like sometimes you want to add a little bit more just like i can't do it i i can't and i see that like i was
1:42:58
looking at them today because i was pulling the trigger on the stock on the you know for the wrong key portfolio and i'm like
1:43:03
how about all these options looking like oh my god you could just turn away looking at
1:43:09
the other surprises i do i'm like oh oh i can't how dare you how dare you
1:43:14
you know what i mean i like like like i'm i'm talking to the the sellers right the people who got the uh the asks out there i'm like how dare
1:43:21
you think that i would but people will buy right i mean i guess that's the hope with my with the game
1:43:26
stuff these are the ones i have is that this is option off this is often the way these options
1:43:32
plays work is that you buy them when no one wants them right obviously either it's in huge sell-off or even it's really quiet and stuff this one i was
1:43:37
buying them here it's really quiet and then uh but then then all of a sudden people will want that security they'll want that call and suddenly it's in favor and
1:43:44
people will pay a fat premium for it but that's what i mean gamestop's not up right now so i'm kind of surprised the premium that some
1:43:49
people are paying for but it's we get it right there's uh there's a lot of a lot of going on
1:43:55
so um yeah but i didn't really die i haven't really dialed into the daily one
1:44:02
it's not quite overbought it hasn't been overbought since when oh wow so what do you mean like
1:44:10
how many i say see what i mean all the time like you know what i'm talking about i jump all over the place i don't even know what i mean but i'm just saying this is a good setup
1:44:16
it's like it hasn't taken off yet it's below five of course it hasn't taken off yet but i just mean i
1:44:21
like i'm buying it like it's up 10 or 20 from when i last bought it but this year you're always averaging and right you have to you'll drive yourself crazy if
1:44:28
you don't average it on average out you have to do that um unless you're the luckiest person in
1:44:33
the history of the world right which i am not um i mean i have i feel very lucky with
1:44:38
a lot of things but i i don't have the type of luck where you can always time the top and time the bottom blah blah blah no one
1:44:44
does but um so anyway this looks good though this looks good
1:44:51
where were we okay stop any final thoughts on this no i get now i'm gonna be curious about what that book value is too and i was
1:44:57
surprised you know what you know one thing i was surprised about when barry mentioned in that let now what we were talking a year ago right
1:45:02
when you're talking like game stop showing up on people's radars then it's got shitty leverage shitty leverage ratios and everything
1:45:08
because the operating laces like are people really making that mistake like are you like a pete liker
1:45:14
so i'm an individual investor right and when i think i think of all of the smart people out there and the smart institutions right then i and like i'm
1:45:21
dealing with fundamentals that i like i got here that that it's in the grand scheme of things like this could be some errors in here and so
1:45:26
forth you see it error it erred on me today but then i think like how could other people how could like the real money
1:45:32
make this mistake with leverage ratios and not realize that it's just because there's been an accounting change in u.s gaap
1:45:38
where the operating lease or the operating leases are handled differently and they show up on the books whereas there's not really been a fundamental treat
1:45:43
nothing has changed except the handling of the accounting you know what i mean and it's like when he said that in his
1:45:48
letter and i'm like dude do people really make this mistake how could you make this mistake you're managing real money it's one
1:45:55
thing if an individual makes that mistake no big deal you don't need to feel bad about that but if you're a big institution that
1:46:01
really surprised me so do then i think every once in a while i think wait a second
1:46:06
to p like do people really miss this stuff because that that seems that's stunning to me if if
1:46:12
that um i'm not saying that that is necessarily the case but for someone like barry to mention that and um it's alarming to me and it makes
1:46:19
me think that maybe there's a more of an edge than i realize with some of this stuff like reading a financial statement or something like how would
1:46:24
you make that mistake nothing has changed fundamentally so anyway um these leases who care
1:46:30
you see this big huge red right that's this sticks out today who cares what does it matter um it also seems like you can get i
1:46:37
don't even agree with this i just maybe this is a point of contention with some people like i don't agree with
1:46:43
i don't totally agree with how these these new handling of these at leases because people call them liabilities and blah blah blah people get out of them people
1:46:50
there's retailers getting out of them um right now if you can just find someone to to take them over or
1:46:55
isn't there a cap like you can pay a year or two to get out of them or something i looked into it a little while back and it's like don't give me that
1:47:02
don't tell me it's a 10-year liability you can't get out of it blah blah blah no and so i don't agree with the
1:47:07
handling of that so but if it's if it's leading to an opportunity well then i'm like wow that's that's kind of helpful for someone like
1:47:13
me if they've created a confusion around the balance i can't i can't buy i can't buy that is
1:47:18
it i can't anyway but in the case of gamestop i haven't mentioned this in one of my videos and now i just don't feel in the
1:47:24
grand scheme of things it's i feel like it's everyone knows this their their leases are short term 18 months 24 months and um and i didn't
1:47:33
did i mention this part maybe i mentioned in the bullet point like the at least in 2019 this number has
1:47:38
surely dropped they were 95 or 90 ebitda positive ebitda like through 2019 it's
1:47:43
come i'm sure it's come down but like and they can get out of the leases of the ones that aren't unprofitable like it's just a really great setup for a
1:47:49
company in with their backs against the wall to get out of it you know what i mean and so anyway
1:47:55
you see these leverage ratios and then people are worried about credit risk and but then they can get out of some stuff and then they do the bond exchange and
1:48:01
they're just like everything's unfolded positively and it's not reflected here yet and this is the this is why i feel it's beneficial to
1:48:08
have um to use both to be a fundamental fundamental investor and who uses technical analysis or vice versa
1:48:15
um i've said how over the years i've value's important i'm a value investor right but the value itself matters much
1:48:21
less than i originally thought five years ago ten years ago whatever and uh but now i'm like i feel like it's a huge issue because you see some
1:48:26
technical analysts out there who think they think it's crazy they think it's great you see this on both sides there's fundamental
1:48:32
investors i say this in one of the videos too they're fundamental investors who think people who use charts are crazy and they think it's all
1:48:38
hot folly i i know this because i was one of them i thought this i thought this is one of the first things you learn especially i have buffett and monger
1:48:44
said stuff about that whatever they say is usually is usually gospel in the value world but um
1:48:50
and then uh but so they think people use charts of crazy and again i thought that but then and then i just said all right let me start learning charts
1:48:55
and stuff because it seems like it could be a good bolt-on skill to have and then i start reading their stuff and they think we're crazy they think we're
1:49:01
crazy for using for looking at fundamentals and i think what i think what the hell
1:49:06
i remember how could you how dare you and i uh then that's when i thought now
1:49:12
i thought there's something here this could be a huge edge to be um to be a fundamental investor
1:49:18
who uses technical technical analysis right because if the technical analysts think this and they think
1:49:23
they think it's nuts they think it's a bad thing that it's a waste of your time to do it but i think how else could you ever develop such
1:49:28
conviction this is a thing and now i'm totally all over the place fundamental analysis is where you can
1:49:34
like protect your downside quite a bit right i mean the charts can help you too by looking at like support
1:49:39
levels and then stop loss right but the fundamental analysis you can see you can really calculate what that
1:49:44
downside might be and uh similarly you can develop conviction if you know what that downside
1:49:50
it roughly is right if you know what the downside is you can develop conviction in a position such that you could hold a big huge
1:49:56
chunk like i mean you see you only see the wrong key portfolio but it's 15 of portfolio you can never have
1:50:01
a huge uh uh i don't know maybe there's a technical analyst out there who disagrees you can never have a huge
1:50:07
position in your portfolio based on a chart alone you just couldn't do it how could you ever develop the conviction based on a chart i would never be super
1:50:14
i don't care how good a chart looks i would ne would i ever put five percent of my portfolio ten percent on my portfolio no
1:50:19
and that's where the technology would say well that's why it's all about risk management blah blah blah right but i think that's
1:50:25
yes right yes if you are just using the charts you need to do size your positions accordingly blah blah you always have to size your
1:50:30
position accordingly but if you if you layer in fundamental analysis then you can be sure of what the downside is
1:50:36
and you can build big fat positions and then when you build big fat positions right and you
1:50:42
can be you get those triples and those five baggers which happen in deep value and like it's it's so common it's like so
1:50:49
much more common that people realize and then if you have a good sized position and you get a triple or a quadruple it's like you just you
1:50:55
you're covered for you just crushed it on the performance front that's why i if i'm trying to talk about a little bit
1:51:00
how my process is different it's very important for me to mention what type of rates of return i'm shooting for because then you can kind of understand why i
1:51:05
use all these tools and um and so anyway as a fundamental analysis that's how i um
1:51:12
develop conviction and positions and stuff and build big fat positions not so much in the wrong key portfolio right because i just i just
1:51:18
mentioned that that that's on purpose because i want to manage this this portfolio a bit different like how almost like how
1:51:23
it should be managed if uh if you manage a ton of money and blah blah blah but if you're really trying to like crush it
1:51:30
um on the uh investment returns you got to manage a little bit differently
1:51:35
and that's where i think yeah it's a good combination fundamental and technical analysis sorry why did i just go off on that tangent i don't care remember i'm all
1:51:42
over the place right now i forget um
1:51:49
okay the leases yeah the leases just get the leases get me going too because i just uh yeah because i disagree with it
1:51:54
and then barty mentioned that i just i just can't believe people would actually mess that up on the fundamental front but maybe they do
1:52:01
and it was like six months in like the the up the accounting changes had happened like the year prior i thought didn't they didn't they happen in 2018 or
1:52:07
something or year end or something just crazy if that's the case anyway game stuff hasn't worked out yet so maybe that's not the
1:52:13
case you know what i mean but i don't know i hadn't heard any mentioned anywhere else sometimes first of all i say this coming
1:52:21
from someone who makes mistakes who makes stupid mistakes but sometimes the market stupidity can surprise me and you as well right the market can be
1:52:27
the market can be is often very um what i say intelligent is uh is very is
1:52:34
often quite fair that's what i'd say um but it's also stupid
1:52:40
it's also stupid at times too so that i'm like increasingly all right this is one of those cases where i think it just might be
1:52:45
i don't know um all right anything else here back i want
1:52:51
i know my game stop right now but uh the cash flow oh yeah you know what i'm sorry one last thing i mentioned this in the um
1:52:57
when i so you see me mentioned in some of the in that gamestop video sorry just one quick thing because i i use trolling 12 months stuff you
1:53:03
know everyone's everyone's talking about like fiscal year performance and everything like that but um why why use fiscal
1:53:09
performance when you can use rolling 12 months right so i can use rolling this is all rolling 12 months and this is through may 2nd 2020 right
1:53:14
so when you look at this front right and you look at operating cash flow
1:53:20
sorry i'm blocking it you look at operating cash flow on a year-to-year basis is this right this game stop
1:53:28
two oh yeah it's all pretty good two all positive right oh 200 million all positive across the board right
1:53:33
every single year even through these years these terrible years now part of this is because of the working capital management stuff right
1:53:39
so i and uh but even simple free cash flow positive it's still positive on this unadjusted simple free cash flow basis
1:53:46
through 2020 rolling 12 months so people talk about fiscal fiscal year oh and you've got a new question
1:53:52
what's your price target on a short squeeze and how would you come to that oh jeez oh i don't know uh you can't a price target in a short
1:53:57
squeeze sorry someone just asked a question thanks for asking i'm on a gamestop i'm on a gamestop vendor right now and i got
1:54:03
a beer too so this could go all night this was supposed to end at 10 but who knows when it's going to end now
1:54:09
short squeeze huh so i don't if you've seen all my videos in fact if you've seen those earlier videos too some of them are super long when i
1:54:14
apologize what am i going to do those earlier ones i don't even i don't think i do or it's not a big part of the video
1:54:21
short squeeze has has very little to do with a thesis i was invo well that's not true the whole time i've been involved has been heavy short
1:54:27
interest so that's not totally true but it's never been the short squeeze itself has never been part of it i kind of viewed it like barry did it's
1:54:32
like that's an opportunity for there to be a ton of volume and for you to execute some some shareholder purchases but short squeezes are tough
1:54:38
because i'm i'm not even totally sure how likely of a candidate gamestop is and now
1:54:43
hold on hi guys should be what is it high short short what is it short
1:54:51
shorts sure is it short interest dot com said it all right so i say that right
1:54:57
now i see this and i it's in the video too right the uh percentage of the short
1:55:02
first of all if you adjust for the float too i did that in the video like it's like a huge percentage of um of the float it's over a hundred
1:55:08
percent 110 if you adjust for scion has to perform so so first of all that's
1:55:13
exorbitant i've never seen anything like that myself i um i'm not an expert on this type of stuff and i would say generally when i see
1:55:19
super high short interest like these stocks you're seeing here does this still not work i just can i still cannot these stocks
1:55:26
right here when i see such a high short interest i'm usually turned off i usually think oh they probably know something that i don't or
1:55:33
this this probably says a ton in fact are there many so bed bath theon was a stock that i got
1:55:38
a double on i i don't think it's in the portfolio now um but there's only a handful of these that were even in the roaring kitty
1:55:44
portfolio so usually the high short interest is like uh it's a i get turned off by it um but in the
1:55:51
case of gamestop this is what makes games so much so usually turn off right not only not only is it the highest i've ever seen
1:55:56
i've never seen anything like it before i wouldn't say i'm a good uh i'm a good person i don't watch it that closely i haven't
1:56:03
been around that long in the grand scheme of the markets and stuff there's people more experienced than me that hopefully could speak to this more confidently but i've never seen anything
1:56:09
like this before on the short interest front and like i said i'm usually turned off by that and i'm super blush
1:56:14
i think what the f and uh but here's the thing and so often with
1:56:20
some of the short squeezes that i've seen in the past there's something really weird about the company often it has to do with leverage like
1:56:25
it's a super leveraged company that's really just priced for bankruptcy and you start a little bit if there's a
1:56:31
recent one that i was kind of following would you call this a short squeeze this sort of thing so it's subjective right
1:56:37
but this right here you saw it on rite aid last year it went from seven bucks to 21 in a week it was a week right i feel
1:56:43
like i looked at this on the stream it was weak that's a little bit of a short squeeze and it was just kind of fills out a little bit didn't go
1:56:49
into the stratosphere or anything like that but if that happened with gamestop that'd be that'd be dope that'd be sick and
1:56:56
uh but super leveraged company and that it is i know people say game says price for bankruptcy it's people talk a lot about
1:57:02
bankruptcy but um truly bryce for bankruptcy it would be like a fraction of a book like a much
1:57:08
smaller fraction a book and um i don't know but i don't know it's really cheap
1:57:14
so it could surprise that's what i mean so i said 500 million for free cash flow next year right it could really surprise on the upside and if that happens like a
1:57:20
huge gigantic surprise then people could be piling over themselves but the secular risks are at this time
1:57:26
so um palpable that you need something more than that and what you need is that like if it
1:57:33
and so anyway it's not let me just let me just say i don't feel so it's su it's not totally priced for bankruptcy it's not crazy crazy leveraged or anything
1:57:40
like that and sorry i'm not right age is just the first one that came to mind you might have other theories i will i'll get to the volkswagen one in just a second
1:57:46
but um and oh this is kind of looking a little bit bearish this looks a little bit bearish right there but uh so it's not super leveraged that
1:57:52
total completely price of bankruptcy but the short interest is so crazy that that might negate that it might negate that i'm not sure but
1:57:59
then what you need is you need people to suddenly want a ton of interest for that to happen i don't think it's enough to just have a huge beat in the
1:58:05
free cash flow because you can see look how cheap it is right now right and look how strong the balance sheet looks
1:58:10
i feel it's going to weigh so much cash on the books the market doesn't seem to give a which is fine if that's what the market thinks
1:58:15
what you need now is you need a narrative shift you need a true sentiment shift and clearly now that it's august 2020 and we're still priced
1:58:22
here uh it's the consoles themselves might not be enough to trigger a short squeeze you might need you need
1:58:28
a narrative shift you need people to suddenly believe that gamestop is not going um
1:58:34
horse and buggy style here within three or four years and for that to happen they need some announcement that goes um
1:58:40
some some major vendor partnership or something or some or some major gaming experience or something um
1:58:45
that really changes people's mindset where people go oh the terminal value isn't zero
1:58:51
um did they go for they go from the terminal value isn't zero to suddenly holy this company can grow alongside
1:58:56
the thriving gaming industry looking out 10 20 years like they can carve out a niche right and now the question is how happen how
1:59:03
quickly can that narrative shift happen right um like can it happen in the next six months as console
1:59:08
i actually think it could there's probably some people or many people out there who don't think that it could but i think like there has there's been
1:59:15
so little news on this room we saw the stores and stuff and and the social distancing it's gonna impact that right but um like
1:59:23
i could envision them announcing something here in the next couple of months at the same like along with like along with sharer
1:59:29
purchases right let's say the exam like if they drop everything at once if they drop
1:59:34
an earning speed if they drop sharer purchases if they drop a vendor partnership or a
1:59:39
major in-store gaming experience type thing right and then they drop like um what was the
1:59:45
fourth thing that i was just gonna say um um yeah i don't know that just something like those coll
1:59:51
and they at the same time change people's mindset on how they view the company that they suddenly view it as a potential a potential growth company at
1:59:57
this point we just need people to view as a potential growth company then forget about it because then people will be like
2:00:03
falling over each other to buy the shares you know what i mean you need people to suddenly want to need to be falling over each other to
2:00:08
buy those shares now it's conceivable to me with this short interest as high as it is it's conceivable to me that
2:00:13
people just needing to close their shorts could be enough it could be i i'm not experienced enough
2:00:19
to say so and i wouldn't bet on it myself i would want i would need i would feel
2:00:24
much more confident if like they did all that the sharer purchases uh like a free cat and earning speed
2:00:30
like the sale lease back and a partnership of some sort you know what i mean anything right now we just haven't had much i don't we've seen the stores
2:00:36
in tulsa and they look i think they look cool um but you need something to to change people's terminal valuation of the
2:00:42
company and and and maybe it doesn't happen i just think with the consoles happening too people like talking about it it's in
2:00:48
the news um yeah people's parents are talking about it you know what i mean if people
2:00:53
the kids want to buy like it's that's what i mean i'm surprised it's august 2020 right now
2:00:58
and we're still below five dollars because i know they haven't announced maybe that maybe that will start to get things going they'll announce
2:01:03
like pre-orders will kick off they'll announce the price points they'll they'll come up with the release dates and stuff
2:01:09
and then maybe that will get stuff it's going to be in the news everywhere people are going to be talking about it and then that light and then gamestop
2:01:15
starts dropping on there and then people just might be playing it for the console refreshes like it's a bullish catalyst and blah blah blah but not so
2:01:21
much the upside but if you compare that with all this stuff simultaneously maybe maybe if they if everything gets
2:01:29
dropped and that's what i say it could be a busy couple of months but if they start dropping like positive news at the position i'm not saying it's going to happen but if it
2:01:35
does yes then okay it's conceivable that a short a short space could happen but as far as to answer your question i have
2:01:41
i have no i've no i have no damn idea as to what a price target would be
2:01:47
because you can't forecast that type of stuff first of all i'm saying i don't even know if it's gonna happen i put the probabilities uh relatively i
2:01:55
assume much lower than many people out there are saying just because um i don't know
2:02:00
i haven't seen enough just yet but that's the thing just like gamestop's transformation likelihood is not zero
2:02:05
neither is this short squeeze this thing even if you put it at 10 20 25 that's huge
2:02:11
right that's huge because then so then all right now you got me thinking let's say let's uh let's let's entertain the idea that it does happen even though i'm
2:02:17
conceding that i don't think i lean toward it's not going to happen just to be clear um
2:02:23
but i mean i would like that my opposite position would go um then the stock would go up and then you could trim quickly but let's
2:02:29
say it does happen um how high could it go i don't know that's the thing if it's just people
2:02:35
closing their shorts and people just rushing to the door to just close their short position not that high because because if the terminal value is still
2:02:42
zero in people's minds then what will happen is people will um
2:02:47
they'll be able to close their shares but everyone will just start selling on the way up and if people if everyone's just selling on the way up the same
2:02:52
share can be repurchased multiple times and it won't be that difficult to close out of the short the short the show
2:02:58
positions you know what i mean because everyone's selling on the way up because everyone thinks not everyone i i try not to speak in
2:03:05
absolutes right but many people are thinking the absolute terminal value zero terminal value zero so all the way up people are selling
2:03:10
and then it becomes easy for the shorts to get out of their positions what you need this is why i do the adjusted float in the video what you need are
2:03:16
like people holding tight to their shares that's why it matters how much scion owns it matters how much hestern permanent
2:03:22
and how much everyone owns because if they're holding tight then there's even a limited number of shares right but then there's a question of what
2:03:27
price do they sell and they'll be less likely to sell if there's a long-term secular growth story there so i mean it
2:03:34
could be a pip squeak of a short squeak a pip squeak a pic squeak short squeeze it could be a pip short squeeze
2:03:40
um of like uh could double or something like that but if if ever were everything at the same time
2:03:45
and really the big one the big one is a shift in people's mindset about its long-term growth opportunities because
2:03:51
and again i don't know what that news release looks like i'm just saying whatever the hell it is if people suddenly go from one mindset
2:03:58
to another then forget about then it could go up significantly higher i still think that
2:04:03
would take time like if you're talking 50 bucks or something like that like which isn't even that big of a market cap but
2:04:08
let's say 50 let's say 50 bucks times 40 million shares let's say they do the share of purchase just for the sake of discussion we're having a good time
2:04:14
right it's a 2 billion that's a 2 billion market cap that ain't do you see what i mean like ah that that
2:04:21
ain't that's it's nothing a 2 million market cap that's um
2:04:27
so it's nothing so that's a if they succeeded in transforming their
2:04:32
business but even before they succeeded people think that they could succeed yeah the upside after a share of
2:04:38
purchase too if let's say the the exhaust if you're down to a 40 or 50 million share card right now they're at 64.65
2:04:43
so it's a lower so then it might be a little bit lower but you could see a gold much well it's not i'm not this isn't a forecast hope
2:04:50
that's clear at this point right go 100 bucks right is it crazy to think that it could go to 4 billion market cap no
2:04:56
what was it back in the day i forget what my video said 5 billion 6 billion i forget i think 6 billion um and uh
2:05:04
a sustainable growth yeah it could but that's not a forecast i have no idea
2:05:09
the price it seems more likely that short squeeze wouldn't be i don't know i've just never seen anything like this it could be your
2:05:16
guess as a good of mine truly i i 100 100 of the flow this but now it's
2:05:22
august you know what i mean like um there needs to be they need some serious announcements i need some serious announcements i need to be convinced
2:05:28
to be honest i'm not convinced i keep on talking about in my videos how it's possible this is what this is security analysis
2:05:33
that people aren't uh entertaining the possibility of it's like well i can entertain if i can entertain the possibility
2:05:39
i'm an idiot you can understand the possibility but i'm not saying i don't think it's necessarily gonna happen come on i don't even think it's
2:05:45
50 gonna happen i but uh i don't need it to be 50 to think that this is a super discount
2:05:50
price so if if i can i need to be convinced first and for me to be convinced but i need to be convinced before the mark and
2:05:56
be convinced because i'm already i'm already bullish on the stock i need some um
2:06:02
need i need some i need some story they need to tell me a story a more compelling story than what we've seen so far of how they're gonna grow alongside
2:06:07
the industry and um but this is the thing with the consoles coming out you can craft this
2:06:12
story along with it we got new consoles coming out come down to gamestop to play like people talk about brick and
2:06:18
mortar but it's like they and i know the stores aren't gigantic too that's something to consider but you saw that performance center in the latest video
2:06:23
too that's that is sick okay um and then let's get that two is dealing with um
2:06:28
social distancing stuff right now i personally don't think this is forever so even though it's a short-term uh knock against the thesis if if
2:06:35
whatever for lack of a better phrase i don't know the longer term thing you could still make a compelling narrative surrounding
2:06:41
these types of things collectively but you they can if they start talking about a narrative here where hey during this console refresh you're going to
2:06:47
come out you're going to play these games here for the the few weeks leading up to it or get an exclusive um opportunity to test
2:06:54
out the new consoles here or i didn't mean you're we can think of it you can brainstorm this this is kind of what i was trying to
2:07:01
um this is what other people have too scott maven and his article as well and um what i try to do in some of my
2:07:06
videos just think a lot about what they could do so i want something like that a lot in these next couple months but without
2:07:11
that i the the upside not just a short i mean we're talking short squeeze but it's really the upside in the stock you know
2:07:17
what i mean it's the upside on the stock the ups the upside is much more limited if you don't get that um
2:07:22
and if you're um if you want to suffer from some confirmation bias you can convince yourself that this is all
2:07:29
on purpose which i can entertain the possibility of but uh like they're doing on purpose they're
2:07:34
with they're they're they're they're dragging their feet they wanted to get the bond exchange behind them they wanted to they wanted to get these shitty quarters
2:07:41
they they can see they had to close their stores like these are shitty quarters um and so like maybe they're just trying
2:07:47
to get closer to it and then we're gonna get an onslaught of it i wouldn't bet on that but it's possible it's possible so maybe we
2:07:53
start getting that better story now and i i'm i think i meant when i mention this on a youtube comment someone
2:07:59
commented on one of the videos thanks for everyone who comments on the videos and stuff this any comments and feedback you give me is helpful because i don't know what
2:08:04
i'm doing i don't know what i'm doing out here those are like give you some feedback is it good it's bad it's not good so if
2:08:10
someone comments on but i reset it like i'm excited for the next six months i don't even give a what happens with the stuff i mean i want it to go up
2:08:15
but i mean don't you super curious about what the what the hell is gonna happen here what is a hundred percent have you can
2:08:22
this i don't can it be unwound in a systematic manner i have no idea but i'm very curious to see
2:08:28
and um with the setup it's be interesting what management does is i don't know i just find it fascinating
2:08:33
in the grand scheme i've seen a lot of positions over the years i haven't been super dialed into a ton of them i've been invested in a
2:08:39
lot of them but even in the ones i don't know it just seems like a fascinating
2:08:45
um case study case study i hope it works out so it'll be a good case study that i'll look back on uh with uh rose-colored glasses you know
2:08:52
but um um yeah we'll see what happens we'll see what happens and we'll all start whenever their next
2:08:57
announcement they could announce the sale lease back before them because it looks like it's closed but it could be they'll wait till earnings which case would be mid-september about so
2:09:03
until then we can just have fun talking about what we can have fun talking about the possibilities right now because six
2:09:09
months from now what is it august february january february but all right we have we have a decent idea as to what's likely
2:09:14
but um i think this narrative shift could take 12 months too you know i mean i just think it would be more compelling
2:09:20
to happen during if you're going to make the case that you're going to re transform yourself during a console refresh do it now you
2:09:26
got to do it now because this is when it's like heightened interest and you can but it can still it could also i
2:09:33
think it should it can also happen over time this could be a two-year transformation you know what i mean i think people myself included are just like now's the
2:09:39
time because the console refresh but it could also happen over a two-year time period but um
2:09:44
like like in like 2021 certainly certainly you'd think by 2021 or i mean if the thesis hasn't worked by
2:09:50
2021 i i assume i've will have i have been wrong about it you know what i mean or they just got the estimates
2:09:55
wrong so i'm like no big deal it's um but uh anyway i hope did i answer your question
2:10:02
certainly not right but uh good discussion and i do agree with even though i don't think it's a likely outcome
2:10:07
i think i i try to think through this stuff hey all right thanks ma'am i appreciate it because even if
2:10:14
something isn't likely or or probable whatever it is it's still important to think through this stuff because even though like i said even if it's a
2:10:20
10 chance of this and that 10 is 50 per share a mere 2 billion dollar market cap
2:10:26
let's say it's a 20 chance they buy back the shares of the exhaust the authorization just a 20 chance they do that and then
2:10:32
it's a a 20 chance they successfully uh change the narrative in the next six months
2:10:37
that they are going to transform into a growth story blah blah blah and uh in a 10 chance of a short squeeze you you
2:10:43
you combine that all together then then then it's like super compelling you know what i mean so it's not enough to just say what's gonna
2:10:49
happen or what's likely to happen you still need to weight those probabilities and that's what i feel people aren't it doesn't seem like
2:10:56
people are maybe people are and i just they're just not public about it which happens all the time but it just seems like people aren't
2:11:02
waiting all those different possible outcomes adequately in my opinion and i think this is the opportunity but let's see uh
2:11:07
if i'm wrong i'm wrong that's okay and um if if if i'm if gamestop works out we can
2:11:12
give me credit but if it fails just blame barry just just barry what are you thinking about what are you thinking no
2:11:19
uh um all right so that's uh i short squeezed
2:11:24
that's gamestop anything all right i think that was it i just wanted to cover that share of purchases because like
2:11:30
did i fail to mention that in the latest video that's a bummer maybe i made a note somewhere that there's still a hunt is there 120 million 100 million
2:11:37
and i forget even at five dollars per share i know i just did that calculation 24 million or 40 million
2:11:44
crazy crazy
2:11:50
just looking oh you know what else i like to see and one thing that sticks out with sorry
2:11:57
i'm on a gamestop kick now i'm just uh look at the rotate this is a good metric i don't know does anyone use like oh
2:12:03
sorry you can't see this retained earnings as a percentage of um assets this this metric is sick i've i've been
2:12:10
using this more and more over the years um it speaks to
2:12:15
first of all if you have like negative return earnings that's like a red it's it's not a this is a bad investment flag it's like
2:12:21
hey heads up they don't have any retained earnings or they've written off all their historical earnings or blah blah blah but like and so game stops heading back
2:12:27
to zero because they're writing down they've wasted all of their earnings by way of shitty acquisitions and so past management past
2:12:33
management it's always frustrating right when you see these people talking about past who cares about their passage but anyway
2:12:38
this was a this was a historically very successful business and i get the secular change and all that blah blah blah but i just mean i i just wanted of all
2:12:45
the metrics i was just scrolling down this side i like this one um i feel like it's a good tell into the
2:12:50
historical quality of the business and also whether or not there's something there i uh let's get what is it up 50
2:12:58
as a percentage of all retained earnings you know what i mean and then they they blew it they blew it they blew it
2:13:04
was a it was just a throwing off such a ton of cash and uh i know not huge net margins or anything
2:13:10
like that but man that free casual half a billion and free count just crushing it now let me now i'm curious
2:13:15
so now let's take a look at fossil
2:13:21
oh where'd it go right oh right there right top
2:13:29
oh what are we doing look at this same thing crushing it huh it's coming back right
2:13:34
it's coming back and it's down lower but anyway when i see that i should move this up because if i see that and i see that trend i think all right at least
2:13:40
they were they were good back in the day but um then it's just like a little bit of a quality metric i think it's included in
2:13:45
like the uh is it included in the z score i have that definition somewhere i never remember that definition of z score
2:13:53
in my screen i i forget but okay where was i am i do i get anything else on fossil let's let's say this dig into fall some
2:14:00
more that's what i'm going to say um um
2:14:08
it look it looks looks compelling sub 4. like it still looks compelling now but
2:14:14
that 50 was it 48 without like without a gamestop like catalyst i'm like oh
2:14:20
right there if i didn't see that i'd be more like oh and then look at this big drop off and then
2:14:26
there's no insiders but oh the insiders were buying but they haven't bought since june but some good purchases you know what i mean how's no one talking about a
2:14:32
million dollars in purchases he was didn't he was still buying below six
2:14:38
he was buying a march too like i mentioned this but i love to see this they were buying when this when all this
2:14:43
selling off oh that's great nice job management um with so much uncertainty right i feel
2:14:49
like i've said that before but uh your step it's the same guy though is all the same guy
2:14:56
it's mostly one dude maybe he's a crazy dude but that's uh i mean i i'm joke when i
2:15:02
say that but uh still it means more this is why i include this in the um i include this you see right here this
2:15:09
do you see this section right here this is insider buying less than uh within the week one to two weeks three two to four weeks
2:15:14
etc but i look at the the number of insiders right it's a prominent metric in my in the tracker spreadsheet too
2:15:20
like uh and the most common example i've been using is ovv um can i pull that up
2:15:30
is this the uh ah ovv had like something like 12 insiders
2:15:36
bought millions of dollars worth i'm like and i i made a joke in one of my videos i would buy on that alone i'm not even
2:15:42
kidding i wouldn't get a huge position but you know oh this is a good analogy actually you know we talk about charts but like
2:15:47
the technical analysts just look at the chart like yeah buy them based on this chart like all you did was look at the chart and they'll pull the trigger like that based on that alone and like you could
2:15:54
never build high convection with that right but the same thing you could do so stuff with fundamental stuff too uh i everyone uses all
2:16:00
price below book and all that stuff but forget that you know what i mean use other stuff like insider buying and
2:16:05
i know you've heard people talk about insider buying but if you see like 12 insiders buying um now i have to pull it up because ovv
2:16:12
was ridiculous now i've been tracking ovv for quite some time and i've mentioned a number of times on the on the damn stream so i apologize for always bringing up but it's just such a
2:16:18
great example oh you see some of the ones we've been checking out was that six it'll pop up here um
2:16:26
and uh like if you see all them buying and they're buying a discounted price like all at the right time and stuff
2:16:32
oh pull it up here
2:16:38
look at this so this was this was from so this is all
2:16:44
let me let me just do a little bit of a higher dollar amount 50k
2:16:54
there's not that many people
2:17:00
is it oh because i wanted to do 12 months is that how far is this all dates what that does look right does it oh you know
2:17:06
why just because okay so that's interesting so if you include everybody and if you just did unique people or something like that but you could see
2:17:11
if we just did one year i should have just pulled this up what am i doing pulling off the fundamentals
2:17:16
um where is it oh filing trade date past year
2:17:23
look at this look at this starting from february so all different people right
2:17:29
so that's the thing i guess the big purchasers were mostly the same people thomas ricks was a big person uh bruce gordon bruce waterman
2:17:37
um oh thomas rex it wasn't okay you know what it wasn't this is i'm glad we pulled this up it wasn't quite as spread out as i as i
2:17:44
realized because it this is the thing if it's mostly one person i'm not saying you say it you throw it away i'm just saying it's a little bit less
2:17:49
meaningful than if you have five different people buying 200k and so you do see it with many stocks you see it with um
2:17:56
um cnr is a great one um where they were they were going ham past
2:18:02
two years they were going hams i guess look at this they were going they were going crazy
2:18:08
cnr one of the top positions in the portfolio this is what i'm talking about like these people are more dialed into me
2:18:14
more now than than me than you than so many people and if they're just going crazy and there's a whole bunch of them you think that one person one person
2:18:20
could be crazy i've seen one i don't mean crazy i i use that term loosely i just mean have the wrong idea uh maybe they're a
2:18:27
bad analyst of their own stock and they just have a ton of money you know what i mean um but you got five
2:18:32
separate insiders dropping 500k each a million each it's unlikely that they're messing up
2:18:38
especially if it's at the right price you know where else you start was um was it stkl
2:18:45
no no no no was it a ckl no that wasn't it
2:18:53
oh you know it was hill they like timed it right that was right before chat was it just changed
2:19:01
i was mostly one dude no that's right so look at james chadwick james oh todd weintraub but not that
2:19:07
much david skrow james chadwick anyway uh there's it's still mostly one
2:19:13
part you're always gonna see it's mostly gonna be one person which is kind of interesting and then you what you do is you look into that person's background i'm not gonna do it here i don't care
2:19:19
but um like here oh it didn't come up oh there you go ovv so this is what i this is what i'm
2:19:25
talking about ovv the past six months there's been 12 separate openings uh 12 separate insiders who have purchased and they bought a total
2:19:31
of 1.7 all right so not as much uh i'm making that stuff up there's been other companies who bought millions of dollars
2:19:36
worth um but i'd love to see that i buy that alone there you go forget price the book forget all this other
2:19:42
while not you see a company trading at a maybe some you incorporate some value metric right
2:19:47
and then you see a whole bunch of insiders going crazy as the stock price is coming down and stuff there you go now sometimes they mess up
2:19:53
too it's like gci check out this they miss i felt as though they were messing up
2:19:59
i think i said this on one of the stream but i remember thinking it was like march 5th and i'm like what do you see it's a leverage uh that they got is
2:20:04
it usa today that they have i remember thinking what are you doing this was early march i'm like slow down slow down you're buying up too
2:20:11
heavy it's too heavy because a super leveraged company like gci oh you can't see it's gci i gotta scroll up
2:20:17
a super leveraged company like this that your stock price is going your stock price is dropping another fifty percent
2:20:23
if you got a super strong balance sheet no problem no problem but if you go to in oh and you know what the other one is um so first of all you can see this one
2:20:29
right all different people too sheen miller wall real money too read 300k and he bought a ton back
2:20:35
in um uh november two so this one's been on my right now the question what's the price right now
2:20:41
i've long been wondering is it um this could be a this could it's not in the portfolio i've owned it it's not the portfolio right now but
2:20:47
this could be like a solid see what i mean local prices they're buying back they're buying the shares that um um he
2:20:53
bought a ton at six bucks and then they bought a ton in the high threes and now we're half that right now so this there's
2:20:59
something there could be something here but it's hugely leveraged and stuff and there was a question of how is it going to hold up with all that's going on and
2:21:05
is it still the newspaper business is that remember they split up
2:21:11
yeah all right so they still get the newspaper so there could be something there but it's risky in this environment and
2:21:17
but it could be a double it could be a double but uh it's kind of risky i don't wanna pull the fundamentals but anyway remember
2:21:22
thinking slow down slow down you got a really risky stock this thing could be this thing could be half again and then it did it went to like a dollar or
2:21:28
something something absurd let me just see this so this is what i mean so it's not always like a telltale like you need any context of everything
2:21:34
but uh they were buying like right like oh this looks bad i'm sorry what is
2:21:40
it is it gannon or ganette i don't even individual investors i don't even want to pronounce this i was like this looks this looks oh
2:21:46
sorry now it looks really bad and uh but i was saying this at the time i wouldn't even though i was tracking it
2:21:51
but then it goes boom then it goes boom and i'm like oh this is how it works if you have a super lever stock you
2:21:56
gotta wait the other one was this one uh u.s concrete okay so see this chart right here this
2:22:02
is um see january and february was in like the 30s to 40s and then it was um it was
2:22:08
briefly it was briefly in the 20s briefly in the 20s and then check this
2:22:17
same thing look at this they look they were 400k for the chairman of the board um 100k 200k all these different people i'm
2:22:24
like what are you doing what are you doing also leveraged and blah blah blah um and uh anyway
2:22:31
so you're gonna be you need context and stuff but anyway why was i talking about this what company was i just looking at um uh fossil so anyways i say three
2:22:38
insiders so three insider's good but is it mostly just that dude let's just look that up real quick
2:22:46
anyone know this guy's background at all now i'll be really curious so let's see first of all let's just see if he's doing anything else you click this
2:22:52
sec also if you don't know an open knights center you can hover over this this thing is sick just a quick take on the chart so if you look at oh what are we going to do to we
2:22:59
been billy dahlia we could at least see what the daily movers today wow everything was moving today though right so there'd be a lot there
2:23:05
this looks interesting right you can just pop this up anyway it's sick what's it okay what's this guy
2:23:12
oh i've looked them up you see the purple lakes i've looked them up before oh you have to
2:23:19
all right do they get any uh close out of some
2:23:27
chief commercial officer evp uh nowhere see ah no no real background i want an
2:23:32
interview or something you know what i mean wearable technology summit
2:23:38
all right there's not much here i'm not gonna dig in too much right now maybe a fossil wear like four bucks or something but regardless regardless of his
2:23:45
background you see me do that sometimes a stream right raw especially with funds and stuff i try to look up their background but that's the type of thing
2:23:51
that i would do but let's keep going in the interest of just mixing things up a little bit um and
2:23:58
let's go back to the tracker where the hell are we all right beast by 143 though huh fossil
2:24:04
whoo let's get that on the top right all right let's go um oh so this one was uh let's oh let's
2:24:12
just quickly just see what the hell else was going on today this one i've been uh i added to that right yeah i added to that
2:24:18
notes thank you very much i was happy to that i added to that i'll add more but i'm not doing much right now just watching
2:24:23
0.63 dbi i'm grouping in my mind like dbi g-i-i-i g-i-e-i-e-i-e-i
2:24:32
and ufi they're kind of all in the same in my mind i'm noticing all right ngs i think i want to add to
2:24:39
ngs ngs based on that tweet now i'm kind of i need some cash but i think i want to
2:24:46
buy this i think i want to buy more especially if it pulls back i like the um i feel like it's a solid it's just
2:24:51
because the upside i don't know how much upside is there but i'd like it a lot more at six which is
2:24:56
where it just was right but now i know i like that it it popped and got my attention again but i also need some cash can i borrow
2:25:03
something so because the roaring kitty boy can afford kitty portfolio bars though i'll race them i'll race them
2:25:08
um 17 oh yeah i uh oh did i buy more i bought more of this in some other accounts like uh you know
2:25:15
i've talked about this one go cliff i got nothing more to say this is truly a play on
2:25:21
at this point on clifford so oh some other people bought two if you did i don't know if i i think i mentioned this on the stream check this out
2:25:27
first of all he bought he had another seven percent to his portfolio in this person oh we oh we looked we did look him up right
2:25:32
norman matthews did we did we look him up on the stream or
2:25:39
matthews part was it party city i don't remember the name i only is it party city
2:25:45
party city it is all right
2:25:51
he's the oh he's the chairman we looked it up he's the chairman at um it's a children's place uh but okay
2:25:58
but anyway this is enough for me i'm basing on this one it's a super discounted retailer oh so it's kind of
2:26:03
a smaller part of the thesis doesn't it seem like it's kind of a one of those brick-and-mortar retailers you kind of just got you just go there and pick up
2:26:09
some stuff like last minute you head into a party like that's what i do i've been there going to like uh yeah i'm not i'm not
2:26:15
represent i'm not the representative customer of anybody but uh hey going to a party or something like yeah i got to
2:26:21
pick up some uh some costume or whatever i'm going to or whatever are you going to host a kid's birthday party or
2:26:27
as my daughter gets older i'm sure i'll be i'm sure be going there just to pick something up because i'm not going to have the foresight to be when you're when you're a dead dad you
2:26:33
forget you forget this stuff you know what i mean you gotta get it ahead of time excuse me you'll forget to get it ahead of time
2:26:38
you gotta pick it up they have so the business model itself looks kind of it sounds kind of interesting same thing with michael's which is a missed opportunity for me i owned
2:26:44
it and then i think i got maybe i got i definitely owned it and i think i got stopped out and i
2:26:50
never i never averaged i never bought back in at the lowe's i was so diverse if i look at this oh it's another 10 bag you got a 10 bagger right
2:26:56
there damn i think oh it's in the portfolio right
2:27:01
didn't i i bought it i bought it in the threes but i was too late oh yeah i hear i am upset about a triple
2:27:07
you know what i mean like if it's just the bit you get with value investing it's the big wins it's the big wins um
2:27:14
you get this triples abound you know what i mean they're especially coming out of what we just came out of triples are um
2:27:19
um there are countless i truly i don't even know how many triples are in the royal kitty portfolio right now there's
2:27:25
a ton and um i was the portfolio got hit on the way down too don't think that i just i was
2:27:30
100 cash and then moved in they're all up but i just mean that's the time to get some five baggers and some 10 baggers
2:27:35
or if you do get a triple make sure that you put a good amount of money in them right um i'm pretty sure it's in the portfolio
2:27:41
but anyway similar bottle a similar business model where i'm like yeah i can kind of see that and maybe party city is even more than that business model
2:27:47
to be honest i'm not totally dialed in but this is what i mean some of my some of my theses are embarrassing
2:27:53
embarrassingly simple and i think uh i could put together one minute videos like i did for gamestop for for party
2:27:59
and if maybe maybe for better or worse right now you think if it works out then we can look back
2:28:05
and this be like oh that was such a basic thesis i can't believe you could buy just that not alone but right now there may be this uncertainty over whether or not this is going to work out
2:28:11
but let's just see let's test just like we test the charts let's test this let's see if it works out but um i think i think i even bought a
2:28:18
little bit more i pulled back under two i kind of been averaging in these low twos just um but i just
2:28:25
maybe it's because uh maybe i'm anchoring a bit but i don't think i think clifford sosan
2:28:30
yeah i think he's he's he's i think he's got it um all right let me keep going
2:28:35
9 28 uh let's at least get into something let me just everything's up we get it up up oh i do got another portfolio oh
2:28:41
it's half a percent that's not even it's half a percent because it's a triple you know what i mean um maybe it was like
2:28:49
well the whole portfolio was up too that's right but still it wasn't a one percent position so
2:28:57
um i wish i um whatever it's still it's these ones that weigh on me all the winners and i'm like
2:29:03
ah damn the ones that i was dialed into all right keep moving keep moving nothing nothing oh what are airlines doing sky
2:29:09
west was up not much who cares who cares
2:29:14
all right so airlines were up today whatever what about spr yeah they're all up let's see what
2:29:20
happens could just be one day copa copacopa oh yeah did we talked
2:29:25
about that right this was in uh it's in the royal kitty portfolio and then barry stole this pick from me thanks a lot party
2:29:31
um just kidding 10 ago
2:29:36
everything up 5 10 oh cygnus did they announce today or something i don't care now now we only get half an
2:29:43
hour left now i'm like do i care i don't care right now i'll care someday i don't care right now cplg sorry i know i'm scrolling fast um
2:29:51
i'll slow down all right crap i think i think i can some of these i
2:29:56
think i can some of these smaller ones i've been trimming all along the way i feel like it can sell out of some of
2:30:02
these fully so i'll do another pass at these not right now not right now
2:30:09
and we'll do another pass and we'll just start taking a peek at what what i can trim all right that's about it look at that
2:30:15
all right we're getting small this is the nominal for the the legit positions but um
2:30:21
yeah like i could sell murphy now right i get so much energy exposure oh i mentioned this on the stream can you believe this was a triple by the way
2:30:27
this is a huge company ain't it i i legit got the triple i couldn't believe i'm like i don't know i just
2:30:35
i definitely looked that up because i murphy i just surprised that was huge oh here you go there you go two billion market cap uh not as big as i thought that's not that
2:30:41
big all right and you know what i want to do someday too is i want to um i want to i want to um like screen
2:30:48
i want to sort we want i want to start by the different things i do it sometimes but sometimes i want to screen the actual portfolio
2:30:54
you know like right now can we just sort by cash i want to sort by this column right here cash it is a percentage of price
2:31:02
yeah cash not net cash just cash just cash just just want to see i'm just going to
2:31:07
see that's all ads now that's a weird yeah data
2:31:14
processing one pb look at peabody tentacle four oh form right there see
2:31:20
what i mean that would say positive net net a lot of it was cash you know i didn't even mention that i should have mentioned that in the tweet talk about
2:31:26
net net you got positive net net you get a good chunk of cash on there um
2:31:32
game stop boom
2:31:38
golf jiffy giffy go go all right conversation okay i'm just curious wow
2:31:45
dxc you can see some of these all right see there's probably you could probably and then you can filter buy-ins that are
2:31:50
buying too that'd be sick there's probably something here if we could backtest you know what cash is a percentage of price then filter by
2:31:56
insider buying there you go we got a new we got a new investing methodology right there um
2:32:03
and then incorporate market cap too oh there's so many ways you could do it i think i don't know we're just we're
2:32:10
we'll we'll test some stuff on our own but all right um is there one other thing i saw a civil free cash flow to prison at
2:32:16
a price oh and then uh you know what i'm a big fan as far as the metrics go people talk about i don't give a about pe i don't i don't think i
2:32:23
i don't care about p maybe i care about p price to the uh like peak three year average earnings or something like that i don't care about who cares
2:32:29
about price to trailing until a month earnings it's so funny that so many it's so prominent you know what i mean even i care about price to book it's it's
2:32:36
very important i'd say but i think the top one is probably sales to price uh or price to sales so
2:32:42
whatever you want like just because you get so much operating leverage with it um and so now let me just so there you go
2:32:48
so the travel center see this look at this operating leverage 20 now we just did that calculation three trades at three percent of revenues even after
2:32:53
the run-up so much leverage there i had seen it with unifi too that was the position of the portfolio
2:32:59
um vrtv which has its secular risks but a lot of it throws off a lot of cash wow so it's no surprise that these are
2:33:07
all good chunk of oh wait didn't i do this before if i do this if i group these together
2:33:12
top 20 positions or 20 or 27 percent of the roaring kitty portfolio there you go
2:33:19
holy i mean game stop right stealing the thunder but it's still 12 percent the rest of
2:33:24
them hey party there's part oh this party let's party party hardy right there
2:33:31
half half of one percent yeah i really like that and then i like evita to evie or evie to
2:33:37
ebitda i'm never going to get used to saying it that i'm trying to say it the way you're supposed to say it but i just eevee to ebitda
2:33:43
and then uh and then 10. oh like these are in order sales to price anyway i was just curious ebay because i knew travel centers would
2:33:50
be at the top pbf i like pbf hell even just the top seven of these
2:33:56
are 20 of the portfolio top 10 22 of the portfolio that's sick you
2:34:03
should you do that to yourself too well like uh try to try to hone in or home in on what exactly it is you care most about you
2:34:09
know what i mean in insider buying these all most of them have insider buying oh pb and i mean pewdiepie is not such a small
2:34:14
position but um quad quad heads of insider from bill miller for his personal trust
2:34:20
account it's not here because it was i think it no it was in late february oh it doesn't qualify as insider buying because
2:34:26
he's not an insider per se he was buying for his fun so that doesn't show up here but that's something i know off the top
2:34:31
of my head cyh stand no instead of buying no they i think they may have bought last year but uh
2:34:36
that's a different type of play it's all about knowing what the type of play is you know what i mean you got to remember like what am i in
2:34:42
this for what type of play is this how to size it blah blah blah blah blah all right what are the daily moves 934
2:34:48
ah there's going to be a ton right let's move quick oh gulfport hmm
2:34:58
oh that looks terrible oh you remember this day i remember this
2:35:03
day this was um oh there's a good store so look at this day so this uh this was the 13th march
2:35:09
13th um it went from 38 cents and then it closed right up into the close it happened that
2:35:15
on this day this was the day that trump announced that he was going to give um oh this this one's good it's also
2:35:20
frustrating because uh champions is going to give like a 3 p.m conference on a frost so this is in the
2:35:26
middle of everything right march 13th like everyone's like what the hell is going on market's kind of struggling it's like he
2:35:31
announces in the morning and everyone knows he's going to announce something at 3 o'clock for in midday like mid like
2:35:36
right before the market closes on a friday and i remember thinking i'm not an expert on this stuff but i'm thinking that's going to be unusual
2:35:42
right three o'clock on a friday who who announces on that like what's the market going to do
2:35:47
today what's it going to do and to close because i thought because there was so much going on like something's going to happen it's either going to sell off or it's
2:35:53
going to go in in the mark the week was so it was such a bad week so i'm just going
2:35:58
to use this as a proxy it's not a good proxy right because it's so volatile march 9th
2:36:05
it's not a good price oh that was the week of um was that this is the weak energy so this is the weak energy
2:36:10
right energy energy exploded so yes this was so everything was like so much uncertainty and it was going crazy it was such a bad
2:36:16
week that i thought you know what i think it's going to be i think the market's going to rise into into after the announcement even though i had
2:36:21
no i don't know what he was going to announce it didn't matter but i was just trying to figure out the markets like trying to kind of position itself for the weekend this is
2:36:28
i'm a i'm a longer-term value investor but then i'm like even i'm like trying to think how do you what do you do to play this
2:36:33
because just to do something for the story you got to do that for the start you know what i mean
2:36:38
and um and so i remember thinking well it's probably going to be the big players who are going to run people who are
2:36:44
going to want to buy more of the stock and i thought so let me pick one with options expiring today options expiring
2:36:49
that day at 4 pm an hour later and uh and it's probably gonna be you probably want to buy super liquid options with a company that's probably
2:36:55
going to run like really big people going to buy it and so i picked apple so like all right let's do apple i then i'm looking this
2:37:01
is at like like 11 a.m just poking around just being all right let's see what the options are trading remember they expire in five hours this is stupid right
2:37:08
i know this but i'm like for the story diffs right you got to do it and so i'm looking at the calls i'm like
2:37:13
damn these are cheap what was the oh let's pull up apple it's gonna be up on friday
2:37:18
watch this that friday there you go look at this so look at
2:37:23
that yeah yeah so this was on the end of march 12th and then um it was it wasn't down in the day right it was up a little bit where
2:37:29
it opened oh i guess it was up already oh it was up already interesting i don't remember i don't remember
2:37:35
the midday action i just remember trying to pick which one was going to go and um but i if we had the intraday we could
2:37:42
pull up the intraday and you're gonna and i remember thinking all right so let me check these options so let me get an option a little bit out of the money not too much out of the money because how
2:37:48
much could it run but i figured it was going to expire worthless anyway so i was like let me just get something crazy and so what was it i did i picked 270.
2:37:55
and first of all well i picked 270 and it was trading in what in the mid 260s or high 260. so it was like right
2:38:02
there but again it was gonna expire in a couple hours and um so i'm like you know what you gotta i gotta
2:38:07
i gotta do so let's do apple 270 let's do it expire for another day so then the days going on and i was like now we're getting close to three and
2:38:13
then i think it's at three and i'm like i wanted to wait till the end of the day because i it would get cheaper right it's decaying and stuff
2:38:19
and um and then i'm like and then i uh and i didn't do it and then the value
2:38:26
investor like the value investor of me i was like what are you doing what are you doing like you don't know what you're doing
2:38:32
i hate to ruin i hate to run a story like it that whole thing actually like i was actually trying to figure it out and i'm sure other people
2:38:38
were too i i wasn't so dialed this isn't my you can see what how i invest here this isn't how i work other people will
2:38:45
probably think of the same more trading type but that's not who i am that's not what i do like i was like i'm like i got to look into this i got to do this let me pull
2:38:50
the trigger and i remember i was going to pull i remember thinking i was i was going to buy just a small amount and it
2:38:57
and i remember looking at it and so anyway i didn't do it and then all of a sudden everything started to run and so then i i didn't i'm like oh
2:39:03
so then i wanted to and i started buying stock positions and some other stuff too uh and before the end of the um the end
2:39:10
of the week as it turned out things kept on falling after so the whole thing it didn't matter at the end of the day but i sure as
2:39:15
wish i pulled the trigger on that because that would have been i think i did the math it was uh like a it was a 60x
2:39:20
60x so even you know what i mean even if it's a small dollar wrong i want to say it was 60 x right because
2:39:25
i remember thinking yeah 60 x or 70 x it was 70 x i think and i remember thinking all right
2:39:31
just just put a couple down there for the story and then we could say yeah we tried to play and try to play flood and i talked myself out of it the value investor be
2:39:37
like you have no edge here you're crazy to who the hell knows what's going to happen here there's so much uncertainty blah blah blah and i
2:39:43
didn't do it so what a terrible ending what a terrible lending tool could have been an epic story not a huge but you know what i mean so
2:39:49
anyway that same day gulfport went up five oh short squeeze talk about your squeeze boom
2:39:55
talk about short squeeze look at this it was in the portfolio but a small position portfolio because i was i had
2:40:01
been i bought a whole ton of energy stuff that week and it went from uh 40 cents to 2.40 5x
2:40:09
in one day you see that with the biotech stock you don't see that see that with energy and uh and then i was i was pissed
2:40:15
because uh uh it turned into it came back right back it came right back down no big deal but anyway there's my dumb ass apple
2:40:21
story and uh you kill yourself because you even think about it you shouldn't even think about it in the first place
2:40:26
but i regret not doing it i regret it even if i had done enough lost who cares because i never do that stuff you just
2:40:32
do it once and be done with that ah bummer uh anyway sorry so jeep why was that up today though was it was it um
2:40:40
now i see i it got booted i ended up um replacing with enter energy energy positions was it just up because of
2:40:46
energy energy was up today just because of energy all right looks like it is it like a low float type stuff too i
2:40:52
forget we gotta move all right vtol this thing's oh yeah this is the
2:40:57
vtol bristol did they get the helicopters offshore i used to i used to hold him but then it was a merger and stuff too messy for me now
2:41:05
um everything's up all right so nothing's up crazy big we kind of already saw these things look at rfp
2:41:10
up again oh vera bradley so here today this is what i'm kind of looking at is the watch list what's bristow
2:41:16
doing do we get time to just quickly look rapid fire rap oh oh
2:41:22
this isn't a missed opportunity i don't give a
2:41:27
this is the offshore this is the offshore helicopters though right what's going on here and it wasn't trans ocean up today too
2:41:33
oh because energy was out so the more speculative place offshore drilling offshore reserves but more show more so
2:41:40
drilling and uh helicopters are stuff that service the offshore and but what about oil sands what do oil
2:41:46
scents do today uh oil sands those are my two things uh if you're if you're gonna try to play a
2:41:52
speculative play in the energy industry um you first do equipment and services whatever the hell they are then on show
2:41:57
like onshore type stuff and then offshore and oil sands because who knows if dude they'll actually be
2:42:02
drilling for that stuff um yeah look at that so was there any news here was it just um
2:42:08
damn that was that's quite the run-up did i miss something energy was just getting we just energy was just taking
2:42:14
on the chin what's going on here
2:42:20
all right all right so just it's just a straight miss no real thesis there
2:42:27
um there was a merger there too it was going to go bankrupt there was some weird stuff going on and i um i just
2:42:35
i didn't care about that i didn't want the risk i'm all right maybe i'll look into that later but notice it's on deck it's not even on the watch list i put it on deck i'm like i
2:42:41
don't even want you in the watch list don't be interrupting me then it's interrupting me see we got to go 20 minutes 20 minutes
2:42:47
vera bradley this one's always looked interesting that's a legit name right you know vera bradley i know vera bradley never i don't have any rare bradley but it
2:42:54
never never really looked that cheap and no it hasn't done anything
2:42:59
but never really got that cheap though and this chart looks like too right
2:43:05
let's do a quick check like if someone owned this right now this could be a quick sanity check this is vera bradley did anyone buy it last quarter some fund
2:43:14
uh is that like uh oh did the insiders control it
2:43:19
okay i i vaguely remember that anyone buying on the open i don't think so patricia miller that was back in
2:43:25
december oh there's some weird stuff going on there mcavoy all right not much keep moving i need to see something for me to dig
2:43:31
into that movado yeah why is my so it's just never got
2:43:37
that cheap i kind of i kind of like movado for a similar play as fossil also a relatively strong balance sheet
2:43:42
this could be a better play actually this is this is in the portfolio it was much bigger
2:43:48
but what happened was it never got that cheap i remember thinking what are you doing go get cheaper get cheaper get
2:43:53
cheaper and when you're looking when you're staring down five baggers like i don't want to say a hundred percent chance of fiber you're staring down
2:43:59
legit five baggers and all over the place movado was in the portfolio it was a good-sized position and i legit
2:44:05
sold it to raise cash for these other positions which turned out i made plenty of mistakes it turned out
2:44:10
was a great decision it's got it's done nothing but it what what is frustrating is that it never got super cheap it was like how
2:44:17
are you still at eight dollars how are you like go cheap or go cheaper but this is the thing if you have a super strong balance sheet
2:44:23
you have a a relative to others a fortress balance sheet i'm not saying it's super strong or anything like that but relative to everything else there
2:44:28
and they didn't want the insiders or who owned it who controlled they didn't want to sell their shares they didn't care like i don't give a
2:44:34
and uh it turned out that that was the right decision to to make that trade-off but right now now that things have cleared up a bit it might be time to
2:44:40
revisit this you know what
2:44:46
because that's a legit um that's a legit brand right there arguably more i mean more luxurious than
2:44:52
fossil right um how about anyone buy that one
2:45:04
nah no one damn no one buying that one what's the float on that
2:45:10
fossil stole my mind float so that
2:45:17
is just not it's not that big it's not that big first of all ah just wanted to get the market cap oh
2:45:23
it's here 257 million mark so it's not that big
2:45:29
and um the insider's only on four percent though okay
2:45:36
yeah it's just okay just not that many shares outstanding you know what i mean 16 million
2:45:43
all right never mind keep going keep going 9 45 let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go
2:45:48
oln damn that's okay it's on our radar we'll add 100 30.7 percent
2:45:56
gi everything was up nothing there okay what's down today huh was tech down or anything biotech dark
2:46:01
green biotech boom pharmaceuticals biotech blah blah blah
2:46:07
wow well 45 percent don't don't worry about that stuff lifeway yeah i never liked that
2:46:12
kirklands that's giving back that was not like a ten bagger though oh i don't get i don't even wanna i don't wanna i'm not gonna pull the chart i don't i'm not gonna try to cry
2:46:19
i'm not trying to cry myself to sleep tonight you know what i mean wow oh look at this straight green huh
2:46:24
the hell boy that's weird this many i mean some days you see a huge sell-off but holy
2:46:31
hell okay uh i don't care about the week oh can we check inside or buying today
2:46:36
real quick okay so so this is forum so yeah no they're made the um this is the insider buying tab
2:46:43
i'm blocking the tab there i keep forgetting you can't see me click on the tabs but
2:46:48
oh that's okay um the forum olm we saw the inside of buying we talked about that but see the red all banks
2:46:55
not seeing much and then the last stop is eric so there hasn't been much since we last reviewed this it's kind of all been the same kind of quiet
2:47:01
but why isn't party so sometimes party why isn't prty showing up here i think maybe it will show let's check on this
2:47:06
maybe it won't show up until the next day or something it should be here though prty
2:47:12
all right let's just check this real quick maybe i don't know when the spreadsheet works maybe this
2:47:17
it's the spreadsheet's taken on the mind of its own it's taking over every oh green hill they're buying again this is a buy i've
2:47:24
been waiting for them to do something oh flo tech oh he's going he's going back in oh
2:47:30
i'm glad we checked let's do this sir he's buying back in let's do it this guy
2:47:36
david nuremberg um he bought in he bought he pulled a
2:47:43
investment management company he runs some funds oh is he on the is he on the board now he's on the board
2:47:50
now oh this is i'll add to this wow here we go nice see i've been noticing that the the insider buying tab
2:47:56
takes a little while to update and so we've been missing out on some some things that have been getting purchased but look into this guy he's uh
2:48:03
um i can't say that i know too much about his uh historical performance do i know yeah he worked at bain um
2:48:10
he runs a fun and um yeah he bought that he bought in march he like or right around it he crushed
2:48:16
it on that purchase and we bought at the same time i owned it look at this 97 cents he bought a million dollars worth
2:48:21
on march 11th and then um but ftk has a a relatively strong balance sheet and uh
2:48:27
but it's it's interesting to me he's buying another million dollars worth at two wow and he's on the board now too
2:48:36
and again i i i i mean i don't we don't have time for me to look into him more thoroughly but i looked into him with all right this guy
2:48:42
oh and he was buying he was buying september you know what i mean he was involved this whole way down and he was oh he's been buying for the whole year
2:48:47
look at this and so i remember looking into his actions and he was buying in threes finding twos and buying real money and
2:48:54
then um but wow he bought again i thought maybe he was done oh bye f by ftk fvt ftk all right maybe i'll i'll do
2:49:01
a tweet on this one too um it's one of the top positions in the parlor this is sick
2:49:07
check this check the portfolio i'm clicking on the dashboard you can't see it but that's where i'm clicking
2:49:14
oh we got gotta sort by uh column two
2:49:19
look at this it's number six on the portfolio and he's buying more circ this is what i mean the ones the ones
2:49:26
that are a larger positions in the portfolio a lot of them already doubles and stuff but still there were still relatively
2:49:31
larger positions back in the day but they tend to have not always stronger balance sheets now to counter that cnr i wouldn't say it's
2:49:37
super strong but it has enough interesting things about it where i i'll cave on certain things
2:49:42
um but ftk um i i need to pull it up again and i
2:49:48
should i'll research it buy more look into it do we got time can i
2:49:54
check it off real quick boom pull it up um oh wow he bought more two huh yes
2:50:00
he was buying the whole way down so it's just a question of did the story change and with all that was happening in the
2:50:05
energy space uh let me close out of some
2:50:16
wait ftk right i keep on throwing keep on confused i was confusing myself back
2:50:21
there's also another one that um i forget that i forget the name but i damn wow he bought after the run-up did
2:50:28
they just announce when was this august 20th we probably looked into it and i forget
2:50:34
i didn't make a note of it though did i
2:50:40
august 17th why did it go up that was it him buying did it go up because he was buying oh
2:50:46
it did look at the volume
2:50:52
one point what do you see one how big is that oh it's only a hundred wait a second
2:51:00
the hell is this okay look at that it's almost 1.5 million who cares one point
2:51:06
he no he was he was he was half of it on august 20th he drove up the price did he drive up he
2:51:12
drove up the price no catalyst because it already passed
2:51:17
maybe he was waiting for earnings he was waiting for earnings and that was the date on this uh what am i august he was waiting for
2:51:22
earnings he got the earnings he looked into the he liked what he saw
2:51:32
he oh he was waiting for the 10-q they reported on august 6th or he had a blackout pair he's a
2:51:38
director what am i saying he's a director so he he probably knew the results but he probably had a blackout period maybe
2:51:44
he had to wait till 10 days after i don't know what the blackout period is but he already knew the results so he
2:51:49
didn't he wasn't waiting for sometimes the funds are waiting for the results and then they take action but it's kind of odd that they announced on august 6th
2:51:56
and then he waited until august 20th which is what two weeks oh two weeks
2:52:03
exactly maybe there's a two-week blackout period or something boom i think we're on to this [Music]
2:52:10
and he was waiting to buy more he liked what he was seeing with the company itself remember he's a director he's dialed in yes and he's also heavily
2:52:15
invested you like to see this how much does he own the company
2:52:20
we'll get derailed who cares this is good research this is sick
2:52:28
he's got yeah filed a 13 disneyland five percent he owned 3.5 million as of the end of
2:52:36
the quarter what's he owed now 4.2 what
2:52:41
yeah that sounds right yeah all right wow okay do we get time for the fundamentals come on
2:52:48
oh now i'm excited cirque okay so look at this net coming over
2:52:53
hang zero boom oh good i remember that it was a strong balance sheet you only need to remember a couple key things
2:52:59
it's energy and um energy play uh it's equipment and services but uh
2:53:04
tangible book so it was trading below tangible which was kind of absurd but they have 63 cents per share in cash
2:53:12
uh after above and beyond look at this look at this balance sheet look at this balance sheet
2:53:19
so they just followed the 10k now i think it was more he knew what it was he's a director i bet it was blackout period look at this bill okay let's look
2:53:26
60 million in cash and bear in mind the market cap is just over 100 remember we looked at it an ftk was the smallest market cap
2:53:32
in one of those early streams remember that and we sorted by uh started by market and it was the
2:53:37
smallest company it was the smallest company in the whole list here cvgi which has now been crushing it but this is why so probably overlooked
2:53:44
overlooked by a lot of names a lot of a lot of firms okay so total current assets 101
2:53:50
total it's a net net oh i said this somewhere did i say this somewhere 102 101 minus
2:53:59
22 oh oh total oh my bad 35 33. how many shares i was sending
2:54:08
71 wow 96 cents it's trading just above net
2:54:15
net for what oh wait not anymore now it's trading all right it was trading below net net
2:54:21
now it's trading above that net but not that much it's trading at two times in that net so there's some time you're gonna if you're going to deal with
2:54:26
the energy play this is why this is why it's heavy position because in march i obviously had a whole bunch of
2:54:31
speculative positions and i wasn't focused on this but i'm like if i'm going to put a heavy allocation in this i want it to be one that's
2:54:37
unlikely to go bankrupt so here we go super strong balance sheet relatively speaking and this dude's buying the open
2:54:43
market what more do i need that's the play that's the thesis it's 30 seconds there's nothing more to say who cares a
2:54:50
huge revenue drop off all right we get it but um and look at look at all the purple and green like
2:54:55
it was okay run for a little for a little bit there so i would need to dig back into this
2:55:01
but um i already see enough i already see enough that maybe i should be if he's adding at two bucks
2:55:07
operating so i don't like to see this you see this negative operating cash flow here i don't like that but it's counteracted by this other
2:55:14
stuff i'm seeing that's what i mean so if i only saw this without the inside of buying i'd almost be like forget this who cares who cares look at
2:55:20
the huge revenue drop off look at this but when you get the things when they're when they're counteracting each other a
2:55:26
bit booked so it's not it doesn't trade at a huge discount to book value but um he knows the value of the assets he
2:55:32
knows not much free cash flow so i can see some risks here the revenues
2:55:38
risky energy risky free cash flow what's going on here
2:55:43
but uh clearly i weight this stuff more heavily huh like the insider action and the prices their
2:55:49
history of purchases and the strength of the balance sheet definitely the strength of balance sheet that's a really heavily weighted item
2:55:54
for me oh that's sick and i just looked at fet 2 which i uh i don't know yeah which i
2:56:01
just i put i put the tweet out on but um more risky than this company but still now i got two of these
2:56:06
i keep on confusing the two too there's like a fuel tech company or something uh whatever keep moving where would you
2:56:12
where are we trying to get through i don't even remember oh the insider buying what else did we see
2:56:18
oh green hill this is a broker dealer and i don't even deal in uh um financials not that much but
2:56:24
these guys is scott bach and who's the other guy robert greenhill they used to they were
2:56:30
buying a ton and um but then they stopped by and then it's like bro i didn't know what they were actually if they were actually
2:56:36
going to pull that stuff off all right look into ghl
2:56:41
but they were like they were like controlling the company and buying more shares and they were like enacting a share or purchase program they were like
2:56:46
trying to they brought back a ton of share they bought like like 50 of their shares over the past like five years or something they went from
2:56:52
like 30 million to 20 million i still remember that i don't even it's not even the portfolio anymore because i sold out with everything else it didn't get that cheap
2:56:59
see i get i get mad when it doesn't get cheap i'm like come on keep going keep going
2:57:06
it's stopped at eight i'm like ah i forget about it it was the right decision again sick but i was i was definitely in it before
2:57:14
i think i was in it right here and i uh i may have got some of these but then i must i think i might have oh
2:57:20
i probably got hit by this i probably did oh look at this oh this looks good though so you'd like to see the things
2:57:25
that were kind of breaking out a bit and then got hit because of all this going on oh oh i like this this looks good look at
2:57:32
the gh chart that chart looks interesting i was
2:57:39
in it i bet i got hit by this that sucks and then i maybe uh sold out because i didn't like what was going on
2:57:46
anything else on that insider buying from i thought there was one more select
2:57:52
interior concepts wow that chart looks nice nice what do they do
2:58:02
residential construction where's the market cap oh
2:58:08
uh it's kind of a liquid but the b riley's involved
2:58:17
hmm
2:58:25
that's weird that i don't there's weird that i'm not tracking it that's all all right keep going keep going keep going oh insider
2:58:32
flowtech that's sick that's a big pickup today
2:58:38
avis ah or carl avis i don't care it's kind of interesting too with the whole hertz thing going on there i see
2:58:44
was a serious investment manager do i read this serious this is where this is a really
2:58:49
serious investment fund here okay you you should let us manage your money we're very serious
2:58:55
all right nothing else right sick olin okay we saw that and then was there anything else i was
2:59:01
going to just pull up or i guess i could we did we did it okay today we did okay 9 59. we got through the dash everything a lot
2:59:07
of stuff was up today what was down no only biotech wasn't there anything down gamestop was down
2:59:12
that's why we bought um
2:59:18
all right okay that was good we got through to go through some charts too talk game style screen dollars
2:59:25
weekly we should get into this weekly thing you know what i mean i started thinking about let me start
2:59:30
but now we're getting into like we're one month into the stream i needed to i needed to like just do the stream right and then kind of see
2:59:37
see how it flows and now i'm like alright we definitely need some time on a friday to like look through the charts it's perfect time you get the week the
2:59:43
weekly charts and stuff maybe it's bi-weekly so let me start putting pen to paper and mouse to
2:59:48
evernote and start laying out what that looks like like it was today monday and monday it was like good to regroup on
2:59:54
some of this stuff see what was happening in the market then you can't always stick to it but if you have a general guideline then that would be helpful i feel like
2:59:59
i've been saying that every damn stream but i haven't i kind of want to get through a month get through two months or something but we'll see
3:00:04
the daily movers weekly movers we haven't really been doing weekly movers but it's important because we're not we're not doing the stream every day if
3:00:10
you do the stream every day it's a little matters a little bit less but we're missing tuesday and thursday right now in legit some days i miss what
3:00:16
happened that day so the weekly would be a good idea um so do that there was one other thing we
3:00:22
look at the charts too like looking at oh i kept this up today too remember friday we were going through the charts we could have we could have rounded out
3:00:28
the charts who cares i don't care there was 40 charts left because i knew we got through 100 maybe i'll keep this up for wednesday we'll see
3:00:34
