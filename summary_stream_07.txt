The text discusses the analysis of various stocks and their potential for investment.

They mention stocks such as Mac, STKL, SGMS, Lionsgate, and Camping World, among others. The author also discusses the importance of understanding the narrative behind a stock's performance and the potential for growth in the future.

The discussion revolves around the analysis of a small, speculative company called FlexShopper (FP). The speaker notes that despite the company's small size and seemingly negative financial indicators, there are some positive aspects that could make it a potential investment opportunity. The company has shown consistent revenue growth and recently turned positive in operating cash flow. The speaker also notes that the company's EBITDA has been growing, which, although not a perfect measure, should not be overlooked. The speaker also mentions that the company's free cash flow yield is at 16%, which is not super cheap but still positive. The company operates in the lease-to-own retail sector, catering to customers with lower credit scores. The speaker suggests that further research, such as reviewing the company's investor presentation, is needed before making an investment decision. The discussion revolves around the analysis of various companies and their business models, with a focus on FlexShopper (FPAY). The speaker notes that FPAY operates in the lease-to-own market, primarily serving non-prime customers. The company's business model, which involves extending credit to customers, is viewed as risky and potentially problematic, especially during economic downturns. However, the speaker also acknowledges FPAY's growth potential, given its online presence and the large market it operates in. The speaker also discusses the company's financials, noting that while FPAY's EBITDA is positive, its market cap is not particularly cheap. The speaker concludes by deciding to add FPAY to their portfolio, albeit not as a heavy investment. Other companies discussed include VaporTherm and LXU, with the speaker expressing regret for not investing in LXU when its stock price was low. The speaker discusses various stocks, their performance, and potential investment opportunities. They mention a stock they bought in 2016 due to its revenue growth and cyclical nature. They also discuss the importance of looking at news releases for understanding stock performance. They mention a stock, LSB Industries, which had a significant increase in agricultural sales volumes. They also discuss the concept of a "short squeeze" and how it can affect stock prices. They mention Overstock as a missed opportunity, as it had significant revenue and was trading below book value. They also discuss Kirklands, a specialty retailer, which they considered a risky investment but has shown significant growth. They also mention the impact of the Buffett bump on Barrick Gold's stock. They conclude by discussing the potential of investing in silver miners. The speaker discusses tracking the performance of various precious metals, particularly silver, and their related stocks. They note that silver's price is rising, and some stocks are breaking out to new all-time highs. They also mention that silver has not yet reached its previous high of $50 per ounce. The speaker considers investing in silver-related stocks such as EXK, FSM, and GPL, despite acknowledging the speculative nature of these investments. They also discuss the cost of silver production, which is significantly lower than the current trading price, suggesting that the high price could be driven by speculation or a potential supply deficit. The speaker concludes by stating that they might "dabble" in these stocks, given the current trends in the market. The speaker discusses their analysis of various stocks, focusing on Olin Corporation (OLN). They note OLN's leverage and recent insider buying as positive signs, but express concern about the company's gross margin, which is at a 20-year low. They also question the company's decision to maintain its dividend, suggesting it might be more prudent to cut it given the current financial climate. The speaker also mentions the appointment of a new CEO at OLN and the company's recent debt issuance. They conclude that while OLN looks interesting, they don't see tremendous upside yet and may wait for a potential sell-off before investing more heavily. The speaker discusses their analysis of various stocks and investment opportunities, focusing on Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs). They examine the performance of specific REITs, including CVGI, MAC, and Beezer, considering factors such as revenue growth, net margin, tangible book value, and dividend payouts. The speaker also explores the potential of specialized REITs, such as those anchored by grocery stores or involved in wireless communications. They emphasize the importance of considering the sustainability of dividends and the impact of leverage on a company's risk profile. The speaker concludes by adding some of these REITs to their investment watchlist.
