1:25
[Music]
1:38
okay [Music]
1:52
y'all those calls
2:09
[Music]
2:34
up
2:41
[Music]
2:53
all right let's do it cheers everybody cheers
2:59
okay i messed around with the opening a little bit i don't know i'm just trying new things i took some opening from the opening from the gamestop video i forget
3:05
i mixed it in but this will change over time i'm just testing stuff out huh um okay let's get right into it i saw
3:10
some stuff was down today well it seemed like some stuff was up today i think tech was up i saw a little bit of the headline so let's just see
3:18
i may have took a sneak peek here while that video was played i'm not gonna lie i'm not gonna lie um all right so brazil down all right so
3:26
i bet uh some commodities emerging markets emerging markets largely stable okay so maybe something specific to brazil
3:32
looks like sorry i'm scrolling all right let's uh come on oh what's the
3:39
uh stream looks like it's a little bit slow sorry about that it should be okay though i don't have too much stuff open so i don't know what that's about hopefully that goes away
3:45
okay so silver was popping back up today i saw those silver and gold bouncing back a bit uh
3:51
but still right there there's not much happening we can see the price point the break above 30 might be newsworthy a break
3:56
back above 2000 2100 for gold whatever gold copper back above three all right so commodities were okay today
4:03
but oil and gas i noticed uh was getting hit a bit today um
4:08
and uh yeah but not much three percent see three percent these days is uh seems like it's a big move but we it's
4:14
not really a 30 move it's not that big for um oh these are the etfs
4:19
um so they remember they were looking suspect they were looking suspect friday
4:25
so then they bounced a bit but now they're back what was that monday they bounced back kind of bounced back all right kind of pull them back here so
4:30
definitely this is noteworthy let's just see what happens some of the price points on some of the stocks too we'll get to that
4:36
i noticed yeah we're gonna see the same chart all around but remember that uh remember that artwork it's kind of
4:43
breaking kind of breaking through there if there's anything to this xcs it's kind of representative of this i suppose
4:49
but um i noticed the price point of oil this kind of people just uh in natural gas this was down not much
4:56
though these are natural gas uh producers but all the same chart right we don't need
5:02
to go through all this anything else in gold miners were up naturally right because gold and silver but not really any nothing notable today which just it's in
5:09
a um i don't know what was called holding period uh not holding period was it uh
5:14
we did we're just waiting for it to do something does it go up or come back down just watch him okay shipping a little bit green
5:21
internet so i saw tech was up today oh i do want to check that because sorry let me scroll back so let's check
5:27
the uh the indices here it's been a couple of days can i check it um let's check this way right sick okay
5:34
so these are the comparisons we'll start with i did this a couple weeks ago i think but that was a good time to check this s
5:39
p versus dao coming back up strongly crushing it
5:45
here you go now stack versus nyse new highs today so this is kind of what we're seeing although not on the is this the weekly
5:52
not in the rsi a little bit noteworthy there huh
5:57
what was this earlier in the year yeah really bullish so not super bullish or anything right that's kind of noteworthy i'd say
6:03
and then qqq there you go i heard this was what was crushing excuse me crushing it today same chart i mean same thing
6:11
japan i'm not so concerned about everything today this will be we just did it a couple weeks ago really that's
6:16
enough hong kong versus p yeah it's impede cranking all right let's get down to
6:22
s p so here you go so wow so if oh so this is a pretty oh okay okay interesting
6:30
just want to see it on the daily it's making a move huh there's it's ah
6:36
didn't work oh because i grabbed a hyphen that's why
6:42
sorry about that let's do this let's check the daily huh and i just gotta kind of zoom in a little bit
6:48
yeah look at this it's kind of making a move past three days i heard it was on it's only been down like two or three days this month huh it's kind of
6:54
kind of crazy yeah let's see the red candles there you go we can look at the candles to try to ballpark that i see one two
6:59
just something noteworthy but yeah so these past so this week really boom boom boom boom this is uh this is bullish and it's
7:05
overbought making a new that's this is bullish huh okay
7:13
um and the dow come making its way back trying to catch up to its previous highs
7:18
i saw there was some uh rotation there and uh the dow stocked what got kicked out something
7:23
got kicked out in salesforce get out of town i forget there you go nasdaq yeah this is super
7:29
bullish well i guess i'm watching the rsi i guess i don't it doesn't quite get as overbought but
7:37
it's hard it's hard to short this right not that i'm necessarily looking to but how do you short something that looks
7:42
like this it's hard to time that and there you go with the nasdaq 100
7:50
wow okay so this is what's catching everyone's attention this is the wilshire 5000 you know and uh that's breaking out too that's
7:58
not just the s p 500 you know what i mean that's um it's like it's a whole it's like a lot
8:04
of the stocks that are uh publicly traded are grouped in this i don't think it's actually five thousand i think it's much lower than that these days but it's it's
8:11
across the board you know what i mean all right bullish doesn't mean it's going to stay that way i'm just this is
8:17
with the charts right we know that i'm reminding myself i know that right i'm like i don't it doesn't mean it's
8:23
going to stay that way you know next all right i guess that's about it i kind of just wanted to check
8:29
on that and zoom in those couples spend a couple of bullish days maybe they can always come back and re-test but then you get you're building
8:35
a little bit of a support and resistance area there what is that okay so japan's made its way back i forget when we looked a
8:41
couple weeks back it's right there everything still looks okay you know what i mean it will be time to
8:47
start i did raise a little bit of cash by the way i know i said i had to do that because i was like
8:53
it's like point something percent but um i mean i as far as like taking a ton of
8:59
capital off the table i i don't see the reason just yet there'll be plenty of opportunity to
9:05
and but right now i don't i just don't see the justification except for i'm just trying to raise dry
9:10
product the tri powder that's all just to um and plus things have kind of proc gotten close to fair value so all
9:16
right let's keep moving i did i didn't i hadn't checked up on that i wanted to see that it's good for us to remember that in the
9:22
backdrop and then commodities we're we're checking this so frequently i already know but look at so so this i'm not too con so we see this
9:28
at the red today right so i see this and i think and i i did check um the individual positions
9:33
we'll get to that but then i'm like all right let me just check oil prices right you pull this up it should happening there's nothing happening it's just a little bit of
9:40
like rotation and these aren't perfectly correlated oil prices in the underlying um positions there but
9:46
they're you can they're pretty correlated you know what i mean you could you can see this chart you could
9:51
take a guess at what the hell the oil and gas stocks were doing right i mean everything was going down i'm just joking but
9:57
um when i see this and i think hey oil oil is holding up bro i get i'm less concerned about a three percent
10:03
three percent move it's just noise who cares i i'm just talking about it because it's the only thing that's lit up today you know what i mean i want to see if you
10:09
see five percent move ten percent moves a chart breaking down then we need to dive in but we do see
10:14
that trend line on oil and gas but because i see oil prices kind of stable but maybe they're leading maybe
10:20
the stocks are leading oil prices down let's keep an eye on that that's something now now that we're like doing this these are
10:26
regular streams and now we can keep an eye out for this because let me just do the bigger one this is
10:31
xop like maybe if oil prices started like if oil prices get below 40
10:37
um in a couple of weeks i'm like let's make a note of this
10:49
um
10:55
bleeding oil wow oh see uh no strong opinion
11:02
i'm just less concerned about it this doesn't mean it's just a couple it's just a couple of damn days huh we want to see what it's doing on the weekly
11:08
this is a little bit noteworthy because i'm trying to be i'm trying to be more diligent about this i um let's check the three-year weekly it's
11:15
just kind of flatline all right you back out a little bit yeah all right there's not much happening here and uh much less concerning
11:22
you know what i mean that's why i tried not to get too dialed into the those those dailies i mean if you're
11:27
like a day trader and stuff that you're carrying even your minutes minute charts you're looking at right um the dailies i'm
11:32
keeping an eye on it's kind of like hey heads up heads up you might want to focus on this but then i'll back out look at the weekly and then there ain't [ __ ] to be
11:39
whatever i'm glad we backed out to the weekly that's good never mind okay it's cool
11:45
it's cool okay oh who is this
11:51
um tech was up today any style i guess not russell three thousand even the russell
11:56
two russell 2000 was downtown that's what caught my attention
12:02
i saw i saw that i popped in here just to see what the market was doing i saw it nasdaq was up almost two percent and
12:08
small kept 2000 down i'm like whoa interest tank just one day but noteworthy that's kind of news that's
12:15
maybe the news event for me today but it's just one day what we could do
12:22
is that compare the two you know what i mean but i don't care enough to do that right now like compare uh qq or nasdaq versus
12:28
russell 2000 but we know it's crushing it all right and uh anything worth checking
12:34
up on today what was that gold miners yeah no news there oil and gas transocean that thing's been super volatile hasn't
12:40
it oh [ __ ] i thought it was just up big wasn't it just that big wow oh wow
12:48
why did i think it was up big someday maybe i guess it was just down big that looks terrible i can't believe it's not uh it's hanging
12:54
in there um all right
13:01
tech this is all this all looks good come on he's oh right we saw copper back above three
13:07
ryder collectors universe netflix oh yeah so oh looks like tesla tom grab
13:13
your beers tesla time six percent today what do you do with this see what i mean
13:19
bullish it's bullish you can't touch it you get burned you get burned
13:25
everything i feel like every day we pull this up on the stream it's always bullish even this day was red it was it made a
13:30
new all-time high that day
13:36
all right let's check the market cap huh that's what i'm kind of curious about right that's what i'm always like what the hell
13:42
what the hell 400 oh
13:47
can't touch it what did it open at opened that too i said oh you know i saw a whole bunch of them up today do i have facebook i
13:53
don't have facebook in here wasn't facebook up big they all crushed it today huh let's look at this we just saw netflix
13:59
the netflix report or something that's a big ah i hate yeah who finance does that oh did
14:06
it just report after when did a report yesterday
14:12
oh must a report right
14:18
it didn't even report you're kidding me you're kidding me
14:28
what you're kidding me oh it's just
14:36
up it's just up 11 what the f these are oh these are just crushing
14:44
it type they were just super in fact whoa that's a big these are big moves these are big moves
14:50
let's go let's do this what i
14:56
might need a stronger i'm gonna need a stronger drink for this you know what i mean
15:02
holy uh amazon whoa
15:08
i mean now we see why the i mean these are huge components of the s p these are huge components a lot of things and assume the nasd.com no wonder these things are
15:14
cranking um facebook
15:26
that was the other one i wanted a fang magazine
15:31
wow wow those are big moves for big companies you know
15:37
this is like so i i say this is what i mean like i talk about this how it's helpful like even big huge names can move big
15:45
right that's why like i always have been repeatedly saying that self-criticism of in my march april should have been piled onto
15:50
some of these trendier stocks that even though they're larger cap companies and um not traditional value stocks whatever like
15:56
they can make moves because if people want to move capital into them for whatever the whatever reason they may have they can
16:02
do it um and they're doing it you know what i mean this is
16:07
how much billion is being added in in value for these companies across all these companies i don't know
16:15
oh apple jeez
16:20
okay wow i mean i don't know these are just uh
16:27
decidedly bullish i um
16:33
and then how about bitcoin today back above 11. okay nothing nothing
16:39
happening here it's kind of doing the same thing gold and silver so now i'm starting to group all these in my head right we're seeing
16:44
the same [ __ ] i don't need to keep checking up on them it's all risk on stuff people taking a breather with these moving into tech stock
16:51
tech stocks wow but you know in a big way though and like uh [Music]
16:59
blockchain bitcoin truck oh [ __ ] bitcoin check blockchain yeah okay all right so that's okay okay and how
17:04
about what's vic's doing all right still uh bobbing around a little bit there up a little bit
17:10
let's check on some of these new nysc new highs and lows all right just slowly i added this i
17:17
mean look at this look at this thing huh i mean now it's just there's nothing there's nothing really noteworthy here
17:23
um at this point with the most useful at advanced decline
17:28
oh yeah let's check this out okay i'm kind of new to continually reading these i get the gist of it
17:35
um i don't really i i don't this is the cue
17:42
middle of line over time and that would that's the is that
17:47
i don't know i need to see i kept this in here for me check this awesome good thinking good
17:54
thinking check this out the difference between i mean i know that that part but track whether the
18:00
truck whether the advanced decline and market averages are trending in the same direction best known for breath indicators as always utilize this in
18:06
conjunction good reminder for myself let's pop that back up is that it so it's kind of fallen over right um as
18:13
in fewer companies are advancing versus declining whereas we know the s p 500 in the will share 5000 are cranking
18:19
so this it's a bit noteworthy it's kind of odd that i didn't
18:30
um oh is that is it what's nya
18:38
oh it's the nyc okay perfect i was gonna say if you're gonna look at it like that you need to be comparing it against the indices in the same chart so
18:44
it's being compared against the nyse composite which makes sense right because it's the nyse advanced decline and we see that's the red line it's
18:51
trending up right and this is falling over it's been a while since i've looked at it i was kind of dialing into these things back in the
18:57
when everything was heating up a bit but again i i haven't historically leaned on these too much so i'm just trying to be just it's another thing i can be looking
19:04
at and um you can see these kind of fell in conjunction so i don't know how useful
19:09
it would have been but still it would have been super bearish you started seeing this in uh late february right it would have
19:14
been like hey heads up this is like this is scary it's like you might want to take what i mean like you'll be give
19:20
you'll have a bit of opportunity to take some uh take some capital off the table but so they're a little bit noteworthy huh so
19:26
people talking about breadth issues i i don't i haven't i don't follow that too closely but they probably are as in uh yeah this
19:33
is just a few companies what's this oh this is nasdaq what's nasdaq that might be more interesting
19:39
so it's cranking higher right but uh it too it's kind of fallen over a bit nothing too crazy but
19:47
we see the breath see the breath um weakening a bit what's this one
19:56
i need to look at that i need to look at this definition again i'm glad i included these i was probably thinking myself you're
20:01
going to forget these just been typing them in haste huh oh no
20:10
all right taking the difference between two exponential moving averages difference between the 19 and the 39 oh
20:17
boy this is some serious technical analysis stuff huh i remember i now i when i said i didn't use these historically but then what
20:23
at the time i was looking into my what was that a stock charts definition i got a link in here you can
20:29
check these out actually you check out the you've got links here to stock charts you check these out if you're curious about learning more about them i thought these are pretty helpful so i was
20:35
reading through them like the rationale behind them and these are a lot of technical analysis books too uh in particular was
20:41
it john murphy's book that famous one oh what's it called i don't have it here it's upstairs technical and out
20:47
[ __ ] it's john murphy he's a famous one right and uh they covered these things in great detail i was looking through
20:52
all of it and there's so much stuff out there you could use i use a fraction of it but i was like trying to think of
20:58
which ones make sense to me a value investor and so i hand-picked these and these are commonly used ones right some
21:03
of the more common ones excuse me and uh i'm like you know what this seems like it could be useful to
21:08
toss in here and i guess that's it and then this is the poke call so let's just remind
21:14
and anyway when i looked at the charts i'm like you know what there does seem like this could be you could catch something here and so i
21:20
left myself notes in some cases well these are um crossings above the zero
21:25
line are positive the difference between the 19 day 10 in the 39th day exponentially smooth
21:31
averages right crossings above zero are positive because because that means your 19 day trend is above your 39 day trend
21:38
ratings above 100 overbought right above 100 rover bot oversold as always
21:44
utilizes yeah so i keep on reminding myself of that you can't just look at these in isolation you're going to do yourself a disservice
21:50
um oh so this is negative right
21:55
is that this is negative right let's let me check that once more
22:04
we're not below minus 100 so it's not oversold or anything it's just noteworthy that it's crosstalk about the gentleman below zero negative
22:11
that means that 13 that 19 day trend has fallen below the um 39 day of the daily net advanced decline
22:18
figures wow there's a lot going in there huh
22:24
now i'm curious let's see i haven't looked at this in a while so let's see yeah looking bullish bullish bullish huh bullish bullish bullish wow
22:30
april may june huh
22:36
huh it was much more bullish overbought i mean it was overbought on this indicator
22:43
a couple of months not quite as overbought now okay i don't know i just kind of wanted
22:48
to pull this up i haven't we haven't pulled it up yet you know almost a month in this week four i think it's week four
22:54
and then we get the same thing for the nasdaq how about that one same thing okay
23:06
the exponential moving average of the daily news i'm gonna say all right it seems like
23:11
this one's getting a bit a bit technical for me whereas like if he gets two i like really simple stuff right i like really
23:17
simple metrics and um these i mean a simple thesis and uh
23:23
and that's the thing when i was flipping through that um that john murphy book some of the stuff got really intricate and i thought i i
23:28
i start to lose conviction when it gets overly complex um and that one seems like it's
23:36
it's borderline huh but call ratio i get this one i even left myself a note on this one as
23:43
i'm like these are useful at the extremes this is bullish all right it's uh fewer puts to calls there's the snow
23:50
what did i say excessively high and excessively bullish
23:56
yeah so it's it's pretty bullish right now out there we know that all right how much did i how much did we
24:02
really add by checking out taking a peek at these i don't know you kind of got that just it's the breath one's kind of useful that's what's helpful book calls helpful
24:09
but most helpful extremes you know this one i got let me review this one again and what i do too is i look back
24:14
at historical market historical markets and what these indicated at that time that's always
24:20
that's a good way for me assess i did it at the time this is why it's in here i wouldn't have added it in here if i thought it was totally folly and you can
24:26
assume it's not totally falling why don't i just say follow i mean useful to your style you know what i mean for some people this is useless
24:32
buffett for example this is useless but for me i'm trying to i'm trying to at least integrate this even if i don't heavily lean on it so we
24:38
did it check it check the box today um okay all right let's keep what is it
24:45
723 okay not bad get to the portfolio what was moving today
24:51
all gold new gold was up right because the gold was up oh ftk we're talking about ftk on monday right flowtech and then it pops yesterday huh
24:58
we all we all getting getting in front of me it's right back to where it was i'm just messing around of course right but um so this is what we were saying
25:05
looked real interesting yeah that day it popped yesterday i'm like son of a is above like 260 there i'm
25:10
like i was gonna now i'm just just waiting right now but after that stream um
25:15
on monday because i was like oh yeah let me look into this and i'm i i'm still bullish on it right but
25:21
what's happening here and you know there's a good article on this one seeking alpha this is what i read after
25:27
because i'm like wait a second let me get the up what happened was they did they did um um an asset sale a couple years ago this is
25:33
why i got on my radar it was either early 2019 or late 2018 i forget and they sold a big part of the business and the cash that they the proceeds from
25:40
that sale were like larger than it's like enterprise value or something absurd and it was like how is it trading so cheaply and that was why
25:45
it had popped um right here it was like what the hell in the market's like oh
25:51
how'd you get all that money for that uh that business and uh and then so this is when i got added to my radar but i never owned it i'm like i'll keep an eye on
25:57
this just in case and then it said boom boom boom and i'm like oh this is zuk and then here was when i was at uh trading below net net and i'm like oh
26:04
well i don't even give a [ __ ] what's going on i'm just gonna buy based on that i know it had energy exposure in the
26:09
inside of buying all that we touched on all that we made a note of this right oh that's all i said buy more look into it
26:15
but then when i looked into it like they had tons of cash on the books in that oh so check out this this
26:21
article this uh by uh fluid style it was very bullish but then when i looked into it what they're doing is they had all these cash
26:27
right but now they're trying to diversify their operations and i have i
26:32
can't i have not much insight read this i thought this was a good background this is a good article for me
26:39
to um to like get back into a company kind of follow the story it was kind of reminding me of everything but what's happening is they
26:44
made an acquisition what was it in may it was a j3 or something and it's more
26:50
a data type um aspect of energy and um so it could be a long-term good
26:56
thing right but the short term play was you got all this all this cash on the books and um we did
27:02
pull up the balance sheet right certain we did that's why i was that's why i dove in and it looked really good
27:07
right but now but and then i'm like you get all this um um cash on the books remember they had over they had 100
27:13
million last year uh at the end of last year but now it's like all right but they're not just they're not paying this out as a
27:18
dividend they're not um uh buy or you doing bolt-on acquisitions
27:24
for better or worse that could be a good thing maybe this their historical their legacy business is not a a good thing to invest in
27:30
um but anyway so they're diversifying and buying other businesses that quite quite aren't what they did historically
27:36
so i don't really have much insight as to whether they're going to pull this off like is is it a good idea is this management team competent are they going
27:42
to succeed in um in um acquiring compet or acquiring new companies to
27:49
diversify their revenue stream and kind of start growing again turn into a growth type business they could i really have
27:55
no idea but that kind of made me take a step back because now your historical fundamentals are no longer really reflective
28:02
of of what you we might expect going forward it's going to be a completely different business for better or worse it could be a much better business the
28:07
way they described if you read this article the way they described what the company they acquired was it j3 or something yeah jp3 um
28:16
would they pay like 35 million and they used cash and shares to pay for it but um it was just a little bit less
28:24
compelling for me than i thought when i when we were on the stream so i didn't sell anything or anything like that the balance sheet still looks good
28:30
and i'm willing to give them an opportunity to test things out here plus a couple of other things right num number one this chart this chart looks
28:36
good chart looks good i'm still bullish on energy for now and also that insider buying right you know
28:42
what i mean so this is this is um you take all these factors into account there's a huge
28:48
purchase by this dude and he's on the board and everything like that and he's an investor so um it's a vote of
28:54
confidence but uh so it kind of counters my my concerns over
28:59
if what they're doing is is a good idea if it's going to be worthwhile um but um yeah so
29:06
i so i didn't have i haven't added yet i'm like well i'm not at it now because you you all right your front right you're buying ahead of you now i'm just kidding
29:12
um but it was it was just up so much yesterday and then today kind of pulling back but now my all right well i'm not gonna it's already
29:17
such a big position in the portfolio right yes number six it's two percent of the portfolio so but i didn't travel my art
29:23
i'm just gonna watch it for now and um and we'll just see what happens but so i like it i'm okay i'm comfortable
29:28
with where it is right now because of the strength of the balance sheet i'm willing to give them a little bit of wiggle room here to to try to figure out what they're doing
29:35
especially because of that inside of buying if they didn't have the insider buying i might be trimming right now um but that's a strong balance
29:42
i'm telling you like strong balance people really they say this like helps you sleep at night you can be comfortable with it even at two percent
29:48
of the portfolio so i'll give them some wiggle room plus the charts looking a blah blah blah i'm just talking a lot i should say all that um
29:57
i should i should have been making a note of that
30:08
after um it's a biz disposition
30:16
so strong balance sheet uh solidly positive net met about
30:23
i think about about a dollar it's a little bit less than a dollar
30:28
and big insider buying from director investor
30:35
i think that's good that's good enough
30:40
okay but anyway we're gonna expect all this to come out ontario coming back down so it could be that i added a bit early
30:47
on this i added right there this they're holding it's holding up okay when you back out on the weekly but obviously i'm keeping a close eye on
30:52
these ones um and rrc was down quite a bit today wasn't it
30:58
yeah this is the weekly which uh looks like it let's keep it keep an eye on this it could be coming back this looks uh oh it came
31:06
back down okay so this is a big down to how big was it down today does it say it doesn't say i would say yeah they
31:13
should have that you should see the percent it's not here that's weird oh right there thank you i was gonna say that's
31:19
weird eight percent down eight percent today that's a big move and natural gas wasn't even down that much right did we say that
31:28
is that 250. so same thing we're seeing the same thing as we did saw with um
31:34
oh look at me this is bullish uh but again they're not they're even less correlated natural gas and
31:39
natural gas producers so um interesting i'll keep an eye on this tomorrow again the weekly doesn't look too bad
31:45
but i get some options and so i need to be playing this carefully interesting big down move eight percent
31:51
on rc that's big it's conceivable that maybe i should have trimmed rrc and just kind of took some off the table just
31:56
wait and then buy i'm not even i don't even think i'm down on ar or uh s or um oh s or sandwich but maybe
32:05
i'm like flat or something like that because i averaged about right so keep an eye on
32:10
this we'll see but i have no reason what i mean when you talk about a multi-year a bullish trend it's it's just whatever it's really only
32:16
if you have time limited options that you're kind of dialed into the shorter term moves okay
32:23
rrc yeah eight percent there we go standard six percent so i noticed that i noticed the sorrow that right and then forum i've been adding to form energy so
32:30
i that's the one i put i was up today what the hell is it doing up today look at that cool i mean how to get into
32:37
that it's risky it's it's risky but look at this this looks good it's it's countering
32:42
it's countering the uh oil and gas trend that we're seeing too just like ftk you know what i mean these oil we're seeing across all these oil and natural gas
32:48
things like that it looks somewhat bare it's just not a tad bearish you know not bullish and these still look bullish
32:55
really bullish that's a good sign um i'm going to say add to fet i i took
33:01
some energy off the oh what am i out for oh i need to add something to here for cash but i have it here
33:07
i got cash up to three percent still too small if you ask me but um so i sold some position and sold
33:12
a little bit of energy but i may rotate it into fvt this looks good
33:17
um but real but risky if everything starts selling off this will get crushed it will get halved easily but if things
33:24
are starting moving up it could go um i mean it could double easily but it could go quite a bit higher so i kind of like
33:31
that okay i think i'm gonna say add to
33:36
fit modestly bearish oil and gas trend
33:44
honestly modestly modestly
33:50
all right what's going on what is there anything else on i'm gonna say no oh well then look at this one huh damn
33:58
damn that's fine this doesn't look particularly bullish
34:05
um i don't feel as though this is a missed opportunity or anything like that but we've been watching this closely huh
34:10
and then it popped right back up um but yeah one to keep an eye on
34:20
what was the volume on this
34:25
oh i didn't do that yeah what was volume on this let me
34:30
check that real quick oh it's right there i have volume down there come on
34:37
man nothing a little bit a little bit up all right just wondering if like someone's taken position or something but
34:48
fossil not not down not down i remember i said four bucks right keep it on we'll keep an eye on that we'll dive in deep if it starts pulling back quite a bit
34:56
should be down one deep damn michael's huh keeps on cranking keeps on cranking oh sick how about and what was party
35:04
doing looks good too wow
35:12
that was still kind of quiet cigna looks good that looks real good huh i
35:19
don't know how much upside there is now though maybe a double i was pretty bullish on it back here that turned out to be okay yeah and i
35:27
got i got a i didn't quite get a double but i i saw like i did i timed that right i think
35:35
kind of forget i'm pretty sure i can i'm not 100 sure because it was a newer position for me
35:42
pds pulling back that's just that's just tracking oil and gas but we were watching oh that doesn't
35:47
look great okay yeah none of the drillers look good huh p10
35:53
oh they're just they're just falling oil all right not much look at that helmet and paint i remember
35:59
i just trimmed or just sold out of that for the most part and then we started in buries i was like that day i had uh sold it
36:06
doesn't look all that great huh will those drillers lead oil and
36:13
stuff yeah we'll see but otherwise mostly quiet like four percent on some of these that's natural gas i sold out of a
36:20
couple of my smaller natural gas plays i had did i sell cnx
36:27
and i sold there's another one too cnx and what's the other one um i didn't sell eqt but there's another one i can't remember
36:35
oh yeah this position this one looks like this this looks bad but i had had this portfolio because i
36:40
thought it could also crank um and i'm not seeing any news or
36:46
anything so that's pretty bearish especially looks way worse than the others but it's super speculative
36:52
even more so than fet it's the it's the most speculative energy position would i make that claim it's the most
36:57
speculative in the wrong key portfolio i think it is but i i feel like if if energy turns around or whatever it could
37:03
be like a ten bagger so that's the trade-off
37:10
not much happening oh yeah nordstrom what's happening did they report and they got they were did they report i think they
37:15
did wow that sucks it's not that good you know what i mean
37:21
so if i if i stink today i mowed the lawn before the stream started so i apologize
37:27
but i'm like confident stuff as dirt was kicking out
37:33
but wow that doesn't look that good huh i've heard people say this is a good business too it does and it's a good name it's a
37:40
good good pretty good brand you think if you get like higher class stuff if you're going to be a brick and mortar retailer
37:45
that's what you think you'd have that people want to shop there but it's still a tough business you know what i mean
37:52
that's why it's not that big of a position i um of course i do i just diversified across
37:58
all retails it's not like i'm super bullish on any of them in particular except i guess for game stuff oh yeah see we made we skipped gamestop today
38:06
wow this is a pretty quiet day overall hibbett that was a good one
38:15
what's this cruise line doing i feel like that's kind of an indication as to the the trendier covid stocks are
38:21
all right now this is this is a noisy day and that noisy day a quiet day
38:33
yeah i trimmed a couple more i trend xterran i term cplg these are all nominal positions now cnx
38:42
oh movado is a nominal position oh i didn't realize that it's not even it's not even a position
38:48
oh that was a good decision hey good move i think i mentioned that on the last stream i boy i forgot
38:54
it i didn't realize it's just not even a position oh that turned out to be the right move
39:02
yeah interesting a bit and i remember i was in the stream i remember talking it just never got that cheap
39:12
yeah okay not much happening yeah i saw gamestop was that why this game's not chart looking good just saying don't this look
39:22
um yeah it had that big update what was that last friday and then came down but
39:27
then closed up this looks like this looks like a short short-term bullish type thing right not quite overbought yet
39:33
oh they announced that they're gonna announce earnings two weeks from today i think um wednesday after hours september 9th
39:42
is that what are they going to do pre-orders or something is that around that time did i hear people speculating that i wonder if their time in that but i
39:48
don't know um i don't know that'd be that that's about what i expected
39:54
i i was said september 10 september 15th but really it's that tuesday september it's usually tuesday to tuesday that
40:00
would what i would have figured so we'll see what they say it's looking like they're not going to make an earnings release before then i
40:05
don't think at this point there's only two weeks left so we'll just drop everything then but i wonder if it gets bit up into that
40:12
earnings release and i mean every single earnings release for the past uh since when so since
40:19
uh as long as i've been invested in the company it's sold off on that so let's see if it could this be the first quarterly release where they don't sell
40:25
off huge i don't know if it gets bit up leading into it they could sell off into it but
40:30
um but um it doesn't matter so much right the big catalyst is this fall and i
40:35
don't know if this earnings is i don't know i'll just keep it open then for now i'll think about it some more
40:41
too but this chart looks bullish how about on the weekly
40:47
it's like keeps getting stopped out right above at least it's about five that's a change huh
40:55
it wasn't more today right so is that three percent but that's it it was it was up one but the whole market was up today so uh but it was up when some of
41:01
the other value positions were down all right that's it for the running portfolio all right what to do today
41:08
we could dig into some um some of these companies
41:16
energy 19 minutes all right so a lot more okay and then the others check dale let's just get right into it i'm gonna figure out what
41:22
we're gonna do after let's check daily movers it's a dime
41:29
um this is some ring a bill for me not really oh let me move this thing over
41:38
um all right so salesforce that was up big today too yeah that was another one that's a big company 245 billion
41:44
wow to up 26 percent uh chico's what's up today huh
41:51
that did i ever own it i felt like i was so close to own and i i was so close to it and she goes that was wow that's that's kind of that's
41:58
interesting they announced good news i checked that out
42:06
what'd they have to say they didn't announce anything things up today no no announcement but
42:12
something like chicos that's not just a trendy tech well they didn't know something would they announce oh they announced okay
42:22
sales improved nine nine percent from the first quarter right so sequential not year over year
42:27
spencer dunks so it must have been their forecast our core strengths blah blah blah blah we're taking advantage but as i entered my second year of the business
42:33
i saw a new management team we lowered our sgna expenses by 37 let's hope gamestop can do that too i
42:40
remain excited and optimistic about the future of chico's business
42:48
we achieved a 37 percent yeah okay okay what's the for what's the outlook i'm surprised the company like this popped that didn't they have a strong
42:54
bounty at the other quarter cashman was they had 120 million plus in cash which is almost enough to cover
43:00
debt right that's good remain unchanged but still they're a retailer so it's tough
43:07
um at the end of the second quarter here we go out look given them they don't even make a outlook give an
43:12
outlook ah 20 is a big move let's see what that does
43:18
[Music] it's kind of i'm looking at this i don't it's not even in the portfolio right but
43:24
as a indication as to what how other retailers might be performing you know
43:30
any comments a couple comments here optimistic about future on sequential improvement
43:35
aren't you gonna have sequel isn't everyone gonna have sequential improvement right i mean because it was such a bad
43:42
no not necessarily no no no because q2 was going to be the rough one
43:48
still the seasonality of these businesses too makes it it makes and muddies it
43:54
okay and decline forty percent year over year whoa sales are down forty percent year
44:00
over year wow digital sales grew seventy percent gross
44:06
margin rate up quarter over quarter oh up quarter of
44:12
a quarter okay but down year over year does that mean sequential quarter but year over year
44:18
wow that's a big drop year over year what what that can't be right is that right
44:27
i think that's quarterly wow did you get into the markets uh what
44:32
people have to say about this new management team great track records i've never shopped at chico's really i
44:38
don't know if you have
44:45
not an exact science however the turnarounds that it's infinite and then turn around off if you were in turnaround mode as this hit
44:51
and you're just a regular retailer this is what i mean that's how that's why like gamestop's a little bit different
44:57
and some of these other like discount stores or did like kirklands i'm just mentioning kirklands because it looks
45:02
i see it right there but some of those like um those ones are kind of a benefit a little bit michael's but
45:08
some of these have been cranking they mentioned michael's i don't know
45:13
all right interesting all right urban outfitters up today so a whole bunch of them are up today
45:19
oh valhalla oh did they do a reverse stock split they must have 12 bucks oh yeah oh i'm glad i got out of that
45:25
one that was a good decision oh that's an interest that's a they um it's like a family that owns this company there's like three publicly
45:31
traded companies that they all own each other's stock or something what is it compacts valhalla valley this i don't even know
45:39
what they are there's three though like one of them is chemicals one of them's like office equipment or something i can't even remember
45:44
but um i i was willing to test it out at first i'm like i don't want anything man this isn't for me i think i was invested
45:50
around here and then i saw it and then you know what i remember this stuck out i'm like i was watching this
45:56
then it was up and then it was down then i was like i'm like ah this is kind of bearish isn't it and then when it's when it started selling off i think i
46:01
just sold out so that was a good decision but like a true value stock there's not much institutional ownership or
46:08
something dicks was up all right so retailers were up today huh
46:16
interesting oh that probably helped gamestop big five yeah we saw that was up we saw hibbetts
46:22
was up oh there's hibits right there netflix wow some some brick and mortar retailers
46:28
were up they must have had some some some just
46:33
better than expected right not so much good wow and i o this is another one
46:38
oh i should i could add this one to that trend to that that trend that risk column right look at this this is a ten backer it's a ten bagger
46:46
i remember reading that it was super whoa what are you gonna do with this yikes
46:53
it's another tesla type company right oh [ __ ] huh
47:00
um smith and wesson that was just down big a couple of days to go so now it's bouncing back netflix all right not much else nothing
47:07
worth checking out i'm starting starting to get comfortable with all uh a lot of these things but
47:14
anything anything worth checking out so i see the dark green i i if i'm going to invest if i'm going to research like a biotech company or
47:22
even a tech company or like i'm not going to come across it based on daily movers unless i really saw something if
47:27
i was like we're not really screen today but if we were like i see this one actually kind of looks funny i
47:32
see the market cap notice how they light up oh i get the price in the market cap light up a certain color if they're kind of in my wheelhouse that catches my
47:38
attention but this is life sciences i feel like i don't know if i looked into it before
47:44
but uh that looks good but i'd like to see some i don't have any metrics over here for some reason i just
47:51
but um for me to dig in i i'd come across those types of companies other ways either from what funds are
47:56
holding or seeking alpha article someone mentions something that looks interesting or sounds interesting but otherwise if i'm just looking for
48:03
what's going on i'm just like seeing if anything lights up for me you know i'm not really in the screening process right now i'm i'm trying to cut
48:09
back on positions but let's look at this one like 21 v in that
48:14
21 via i was gonna say that doesn't sound like an american company and then i see the adr like they wouldn't it doesn't an
48:20
american company they usually don't start with numbers like that let's see let's see what it is
48:29
it's sa that's often it's not always south america but i would have thought a chinese company
48:40
oh yes yes got that right they got i've seen uh no that's that's kind of
48:46
funny right um i've seen like numbers in their company names before uh that's uh just that's kind of funny
48:53
um but i don't know anything about it so i'm not now i don't know i don't even need to look into it right i
48:58
could have told that just based on that name um that's i usually i don't really deal and not um especially smaller
49:05
chinese companies just because i it's tough to assess the quality of the financials that you might
49:10
see in the financial statements you don't i mean it's tough i've just seen it not work out so many times that i kind of just uh um overlook them
49:19
many times there's some good chinese companies don't get me wrong it's just the ones that are tend to the deep value ones that would be in my wheelhouse it's
49:24
like that's just added risk i get enough going on dealing a deep value stock you know what i mean it's just another one that makes me
49:30
uncomfortable um and see anything sticking out here i don't see [ __ ] and i know we just looked into that some
49:37
green so like how about this one this is a wild telecommunications good sized market cap
49:42
nothing's really uh the revenue 700 go go i've heard of that one before but like i'm not looking i'm not looking for
49:48
this stuff right oh [ __ ] that looks okay nah i don't feel like dating you can do this all day you know what i mean i
49:53
can't do this all day let's just just for i know we don't do this we haven't done this this much that much yet uh and then these are red these are
49:59
fine these financials are real estates or reits or something uh health insurance
50:05
insurance yeah i don't care about that
50:10
omix so what's that this is um um the blues and industrials
50:16
but um look at revenue is three million ah right there this column right here oh can i do it cause this work this time
50:23
i can't get it working i need a new um highlighter thing i'm meant to look into that
50:29
get a new highlighter i gotta legit have to remind myself for this come on
50:34
how are you gonna know what i'm talking about i'm like pointing at stuff like you know what the hell i'm talking about
50:43
netflix inhibit okay well here's okay so how about this
50:48
one alkaline um just alkaline what alkaline water
50:54
company uh 100 million dollar market cap that's a consumer staples this yellow i don't see the
51:00
soft drinks i don't even know that one you know that one uh revenue's 45 million really small
51:06
all right let's just pop it open but i don't see anything lit up over on this side legit there's nothing lit up over this
51:11
side so that's something like something like this i'm it's unlikely unless something's lit up
51:17
or somewhere i come across i'm going to come across these types of companies other ways you know what i mean maybe if i pulled this up and i was also in screening mode
51:24
i'm not in i'm not in a screening mode right now i don't really care at this time i'll care again but right now i've got enough damn
51:29
positions that turret didn't look that compelling and so i just got to keep moving like i said you do this [ __ ] all
51:34
day okay so there's the up what was down today a lot of oil stuff right oh not that much see i'm glad i keep it
51:40
ten percent if you do five percent there's so much to look at i just show me the big movers and uh wow that's a big down what is
51:47
this have i owned this before no i don't even have it on a watch list that's an auto parts company but look at this all right see i see some things that catch my
51:53
attention here 44 though that's bearish look at this chart what's this [ __ ]
51:59
what's it doing today holy toledo huh look at that whoa
52:06
pull one up for the longest not man look at that volume too damn
52:13
that's super bearish oh this is i probably wouldn't like i see this that
52:19
would probably be enough for me i thought i'd be digging it i might be interested like right here on huge selloffs that's what i mean you can
52:25
pick up some i i don't mean to i'm sorry garrett motion but i'm going to group you on you can pick up some [ __ ] charts that look
52:30
terrible maybe have a super speculative outlook when everything's selling off you can pick up some of those you know
52:36
just to diversify a little bit and then it could go up huge right but in this type of a market you get like this there's just
52:43
how could i what could i what would you do with this oh we get the business right here what do they do sells turbocharger and electric boosting
52:49
technologies for light and commercial vehicle original equipment manufacturers oh it's based in switzerland wow
52:57
revenue's 3 billion that's a good size company though okay all right now it's kind of it's not a it's not nothing 300 million
53:05
market cap after the huge sell-off three almost three billion in revenues you get uh um it would be a triple
53:13
to the 52-week high i don't actually have a value on this but uh price to sales all right so it's
53:19
around 10 that one i can do i i usually think price to sale so i'm trying to get used to sales to price right
53:26
and i see some stuff let up what is this a 70 e yield okay that's suspect but a 40 operating
53:31
cash flow all right should we pull that up let's do it how have i i'm surprised that um
53:37
there's an auto parts company i said this for another company too it wasn't this one there was an auto parts company like in my wheelhouse market cap wise
53:44
revenues revenue wise and i like wasn't on a watch list or i hadn't heard of it that always surprises me because i'm at least usually aware of
53:50
these but you oh i know why because it's only out in 2018 you know what i mean
53:55
uh so like new ones if you've come out in the past year or two i might not i might not know it which it's no big deal but um i always try to
54:01
track as many as possible all right but that chart looks so bad did they like take it public they did
54:07
they like take it public to to so the insiders could benefit they take it public at the right price and stuff
54:12
and now it looks like [ __ ] does anyone own it ah well wisdom what you got for me anyone there's no one
54:18
gonna own this no one's gonna own this no one's gonna own this no way
54:26
oh there's some value investors out there i don't know them though deccan decan that can value investors
54:32
they have value investors in their name yeah no one else does
54:39
geez all right now a quick peek at what they're holding now i don't know
54:46
wow this is uh they don't have many positions they were trimming maybe they heard oh herbalife yeah not
54:52
this isn't my this isn't my style of value investing all right let's just take a quick peek you know what i mean
54:58
was it gtx all right so uh oh i'm gonna have to fix
55:04
this so this is look at this it's quarterly again oh man
55:09
this that means they changed their uh let me just do this sorry it's gonna take me
55:15
10 seconds look at that long name oh no am i gonna have to do this for
55:20
every tab you're killing me smalls you're killing me smalls
55:27
oh that's gonna suck i was to say do you see that long
55:33
history i'm like how are you going to have that long of a history we know you just went public is because it was quarterly data ah
55:39
i feel like i'm going to have to do this for all the spreadsheets to add in that variable hey if it says this type of phrase
55:45
i know you don't understand i'm kind of like this is me like i'm talking a lot to myself but um all right so anything here look
55:52
at revenues declining jeez ebitda solid ebitda to the price um one times
55:59
ebitda this looks like a mess some operating cash flow
56:05
what is here so automatically this is an added risk right if you only have three years to work off of added risk at a risk i and i can't even
56:13
dig into these numbers it's just everything i'm seeing looks so suspect is it how about seeking alpha oh you
56:19
can't see behind me i got the links here to these things so we pull this up
56:25
we're not going to see anything just no way balance sheet will oh
56:30
there's a warning ah that's the type of thing you see 40 move there's like some people are there's like a um what's that phrase that they use they
56:36
toss in the 10k going concern warning that's that type of a move of people like we get to get out of this today
56:42
and everyone sells remember that see that volume ah you don't see this every day look at
56:49
that volume circ 8 million plus they usually don't even get over a million
56:54
that's crazy does that mean that you know something was announced really bearish man seeking alpha has
56:59
been clutched lately huh to get that quick take you usually have to pull up the press release so that's just what i do or
57:05
you pull up yahoo finance and scroll down all that that's been less reliable but seeking alpha's been doing good in this news front i'll give him props
57:12
exploring alternatives for balance sheet restructuring oh my forget it forget it how long we wasted
57:17
this five plus minutes what a waste that's okay um
57:24
in a data oh this one's back down that one was up remember i said i'm not gonna look into that one i've owned it back in
57:29
the day but i don't rex down oh okay they think they do some
57:34
biodiesel stuff whoa that's down big they do biodiesel right
57:44
ethanol yeah they had other operations too ethanol and byproducts in refined coal but i think it's mostly
57:52
distillers grant and non-food oh that's a big move down what happened
57:58
do they uh what about the other one there's a couple of these so when you see one big move like that you check
58:03
check the industry uh renewable energy group a couple of these um
58:08
firms that use that corn as input to generate some fuel um and then what's the other one gpre we
58:16
just looked at gpr recently here we go if we saw our insider buying
58:21
on gpre right we're starting to get in the swing of it here remembering stuff cool cool cool cool cool yeah from todd becker he's the ceo
58:28
we kind of just been waiting for a bit of a pullback though oh it kind of took off a little bit there is that cause corn prices were in
58:34
the gutter
58:40
oh it's time to come up here we go so you can see what i mean if you can you know with these companies if you know what corn is doing we should
58:46
have guessed that i should have guessed that before we pulled this up damn um but uh and this is
58:52
part of a lot of stuff has bounced all the way back right but the corn prices were in the gutter so you can expect these to to rise these types of companies because
58:58
corn is an input for them and uh so it goes and then we see this down move and then we go all right well something probably happened although
59:04
because we started a couple companies that's why i would have guessed that something was happening with corn it's clearly uh starting to bounce back
59:10
um that's a good size move for corn but but that was a big move in uh rex
59:17
something else they must have announced today or something oh let's come on seek alpha don't fail
59:23
us now don't fail us now
59:30
production plan shutdown wipes out wrecks oh this is great all right so just the big um biofuel
59:37
producers tossed 15 million pet debt mccain oh they got out okay so they're struggling a bit i'm not going to dial
59:42
in right now just uh we'll keep an eye on them okay cool cool oh you know what i'm
59:48
gonna check now that we got corn up what about lumber
59:54
oh that thing huh that is that's impressive it's bouncing right
1:00:00
back is it going to keep going it's going to break a thousand i mean usually the whole round numbers type thing does that apply i guess it
1:00:05
applies to commodities because commodities can trade and there's technical analysis so you i
1:00:10
think people use technical analysis on them quite frequently so um but big round numbers for something like lumber maybe maybe it's coming for a thousand
1:00:18
um is it i don't think so these are all time highs
1:00:24
wow i don't know if you're dealing with the fl supply shortages you there's no real
1:00:30
it's not like these numbers are a god mean anything much it's just supply and demand really
1:00:35
so what are some other kirkland type companies i forget um well you know what we can do watch this
1:00:41
let's check let's check this out let's see if this works pierce all those
1:00:47
are charts but i want to go to the um do i have the industry oh no do i only
1:00:54
have the peers oh i guess i don't have it so what if i
1:00:59
wanted to jump straight to the um oh i guess i don't have it it seems like i should have a link to bring me to this
1:01:05
industry but we know what it is we know what the industry is consumer discretionary
1:01:10
um oh that's the sector rather i don't feel like digging in right now
1:01:16
all right so bristol come back i know we know it's just up yesterday all right there's not much going on all right we got this we in an hour we've been
1:01:21
through the portfolio the macro stuff and uh and the daily movers um let's just check inside of mine quick
1:01:31
anything happen today oxy okay um
1:01:39
i saw there was another camping world inside of byron he's really going he's going at it but other than that i
1:01:45
don't think there was much yep so he did another 500k check this he's really going at it huh
1:01:50
i've been trimming right um oh i missed that oh no we saw that
1:01:57
excuse me so we bought another million on top of those purchases he's making a statement here huh look at that
1:02:03
just about every day then he's up in his purchases what's the date today
1:02:10
yeah let's see every day he's done it every day since the earnings announcements when it fell it collapsed collapsed dropped from like
1:02:16
40 to 30. and now it's been kind of looking a little bit
1:02:21
i've been trimming because it's just because uh but i remember the trend still looks bullish that's my thing it still looks bullish i see no reason
1:02:28
to sell out just you're seeing a pull back here and this looked a little bit alarming yesterday but we're right there it's holding up okay oh this rsi is
1:02:36
breaking down in the daily though huh so i mean this is a little bit bare so that's
1:02:42
if you had asked me when it was here what we were doing it's like it still looked okay but this is starting to look bearish you know what i mean but um
1:02:48
where's the downside down to the 20s and then the question is do you add and what if we pull up the weekly
1:02:56
weekly looks um a little bit okay like it's moral support or anything but the rsi is
1:03:02
just coming under overbought now all right i don't know i'm just watching it for now i'm just put trimming trimming out of
1:03:08
the position because the upside is is much more limited now than it was when i was trading out 5 10 bucks you know but him buying is uh is a good sign cool
1:03:17
all right where were we oh the inside about nothing else happening though right
1:03:23
lions gate nothing cool all right we're getting
1:03:30
caught up this is a sec
1:03:36
close out of some stuff keep the stream quick okay all right and then on the can we do the
1:03:42
weekly i haven't the weekly this should be like the friday thing we do just see what was moving on the week because we're missing days
1:03:48
you see ftk up cry wow a lot of a lot of roaring kitty portfolios the biggest movers of the week huh this is sick
1:03:55
but none none huge positions except for ftk i can't believe ftk is so big now huh
1:04:01
it's really cranked yeah because it's up it's up 100 and it
1:04:07
was already a big position in the portfolio that's why right i mean let's me
1:04:12
let's hope we see the same with gamestop you know but um barbecue holdings we looked into that
1:04:18
whoa what's that doing what was our note on that barbecue
1:04:24
it's not here last week buy small add more at three oh i didn't
1:04:30
buy that oh good move look
1:04:36
what i say buy small oh glad we took a note buy small add more three david cunningham chairman of the board with 15
1:04:42
involved since 2018 patrick walsh bandera wexford in total see oh you can't see this no oh i should
1:04:47
zoom in can you not see that that well i never realized how small that looked oh there we go sick oh
1:04:58
make it a little bit bigger there we go that's better
1:05:05
and then totally own over 35 stock probably popped on 819 because conan bought 250k
1:05:10
shares on total oh that's right he was all the volume oh that's right oh that's right the insider buying oh
1:05:17
[ __ ] marginal safety questionable that's right uh that's right
1:05:24
i should have had it small to get it in the portfolio let's do that
1:05:29
i'm just gonna copy the damn note
1:05:38
i forgot to do that i mean because i said when i say small in my eye less lower priority you know what i mean but it's important to get in that portfolio
1:05:46
but uh we know if he was to lie and share that volume it's like there's not really much
1:05:51
to go off of there but that this is a good one this is why tracking is this can be really helpful because it's like there's something unfolding here
1:05:57
and maybe the market hasn't really picked up on it because it's so damn small but david cunning canaan cannon whatever the hell his name is
1:06:03
he's uh he's aware and now we're aware too so if the market sells off and this pulls back just along with everything else we're ready to go
1:06:09
and but it's even still a good idea to have in the portfolio too because you're even more dialed into it
1:06:16
um you remember what was his name courage and conviction he was the one saying it was eight back in the day of course
1:06:22
that's probably changed yeah margin of safety questionable okay
1:06:28
i'm kind of thinking do i still have it in the fundamentals at all probably not
1:06:36
no it's not there anymore i think i just overwrote it okay um anything else stick out anything else
1:06:43
worth checking out in here probably one i gotta remove this this is they changed their ticker poly one
1:06:49
i gotta clean that up
1:06:57
i gotta update in the universe remember that universe like i get that universe i actually because i could use evernote
1:07:03
i've been i've been updating companies less frequently in the universe itself but that's what i'd be doing to add to
1:07:09
update valuations and take notes but i've been using evernote so and plus it's more accessible to me this way you
1:07:15
know what i mean like really i take notes in this this universe spreadsheet that i have right
1:07:21
so i'll take the note um well you'll see it and then ideally it would be right in this column just like i have the business right here
1:07:27
but we would have the note and it would be a column we'd just click it and we'd see the note and it would be everywhere throughout the spreadsheet right now i've got a command
1:07:32
f in the note but i'm still not totally sold on which one's easier for me really it should all be in a database right
1:07:38
i guess that's my hesitations that's how it should be and i don't want to do the effort put in the effort
1:07:45
but um i'd submit here you know what i mean there was something i don't feel like i don't feel like doing this right now pol
1:07:51
and there's a couple other things i needed to update too i can't do that now okay um anything else here
1:07:58
appellation mark 8 billion market cap no nothing worth checking out i saw [ __ ] shopper was kind of pulling back a little bit this today
1:08:04
said mark michaels these are all the big ups this past week stealth gas
1:08:12
forum up yup yup yup yup facebook wow impressive impressive and what was down
1:08:18
big
1:08:23
um wow a lot of uh consumer discretionary stuff but things that were up big too well
1:08:28
kirklands was the other one's not so much
1:08:34
um all right
1:08:39
all right i don't feel like digging into all these right now
1:08:46
i'm not seeing anything okay um just some stuff up some stuff down what else can you take that's it that's the
1:08:51
takeaway some stuff up some stuff down okay and then we already looked at insider buying but this would be the weekly
1:08:57
oh yeah there was a small insider buy on pump if you saw that it's right here this this column right here is only 75 million but i took note of that it
1:09:03
wasn't the um those those brothers who took the was it wilkes brothers it wasn't those guys it
1:09:09
was some insider but this is i think this is the type is this the top energy position oh it's it's becoming a smaller percentage of
1:09:15
the portfolio because everything's kind of outperforming it's kind of been doing nothing but i'm still bullish on it and i still like the balance sheet
1:09:20
um i never did add xerox
1:09:28
anything else i still feel like somebody like why isn't camping world here isn't that kind of weird
1:09:35
it seems like it should be here
1:09:42
let me just check this real quick i'll have to look into that too oh it's there just further down
1:09:54
all right okay but we already looked at we're kind of like dialed into insider buying so i know there's not much here
1:10:00
to take note of um okay all right okay and i just saw in this
1:10:06
note there was something i wanted to check out continue to keep it close on olln oh we said that oh we said that on monday there you go check out ta on a pullback to 15. dig
1:10:14
into fossil more i don't feel like that now revisit movado i don't feel like that jt oh sic
1:10:19
residential construction yeah what's that how did we come across that i don't remember now let me type that in the ad hoc one real quick
1:10:29
i could update that too all right okay anything anything that we've been doing kind of
1:10:34
i'm glad we got so much time we couldn't finish out the those roaring kitty portfolio charts too i haven't done that in a while that's what
1:10:39
i mean so now i've we just did those hundred oh do i still have it somewhere i closed out of it
1:10:47
now we've gotten through the first hundred charts but i don't care about the rest right now we'll do it again somewhere didn't we just we did it on
1:10:52
friday it's like once once every seven days is enough for me you know okay what's
1:10:58
sex number seven oh it's still looking up all right what's this what is this residential construction
1:11:10
sick still loading up
1:11:18
all right so revenues i like this all right right on the five is it not in the universe what's going on here select
1:11:24
interior oh i have it open let me just check this sorry it's um
1:11:36
oh it's a new company there you go that's why it's not on my that's not so i don't know it i don't know this company
1:11:49
i like that sick okay what do we got revenues growing not much it's kind of
1:11:56
slow negative tangible book some debt
1:12:02
any earnings no dividend earnings david evato of a dollar what's it trading at
1:12:09
i don't even remember how we came across this i should have documented that oh wow that looks good what'd we say ebitdo of a buck though
1:12:16
doesn't look super cheap wow was that a five bagger nice i wish i'd been tracking it huh
1:12:22
residential construction too damn that would have been a nice one that would have been a nice one
1:12:30
bummer what's the actual business is that all
1:12:36
it is resident residential construction consumer cyclical yeah and they distribute interior building
1:12:43
products for residential interior design services markets in the united states okay so that's kind of um
1:12:50
it's uh it's going to be aligned with the some positions that are in the portfolio right well you got home builders which there's a lot of in there already
1:12:55
and then cnr which is one of the top positions that's building products as well more exterior type stuff as opposed to
1:13:01
interior type things but this is a similar play and as you saw cnr is one of the top positions so
1:13:06
this definitely would have made it made the cut if i had been following it um interior design services what do they
1:13:13
do what's in it how much money can you make isn't how how have they been doing
1:13:21
three years this sucks it's just not enough time
1:13:26
oh they're not they're not making any money look at that miners but they haven't they haven't been profitable yet which isn't just it's not the end of
1:13:32
the discussion right but i start to get what the hell am i going to do this gets tough for me
1:13:37
they have some operating cash flow down at the bottom here this row right here um a buck 57 trailing 12 months
1:13:46
some simple free cash flow right here's simple free cash flow just operating cash flow less capex they
1:13:52
got a simple free cash flow of a buck 25 all right well that's not bad was it inside or buying
1:14:03
oh b riley on solace um
1:14:12
while they first bought in they first bought in in um september 2018. it's interesting
1:14:19
oh that was when i was going public oh it's one of these weird ones i never get super comfortable with these ones they're like involved
1:14:26
with taking it public they're like the pe firms they know much more than i do and
1:14:33
they're i guess they're buying right not much
1:14:43
i thought that's always a little bit of a turn off when i see like b riley and them getting involved i'm not knocking them they could they're
1:14:49
gonna be great investors but i every time they get involved it like it's like it becomes a different type of a play
1:14:55
for me
1:15:00
i only got three years to go off of too does anyone say anything on seeking alpha i need something at this point i need to
1:15:06
see something before i'd start i'll add it to the universe don't get me wrong
1:15:13
overlooked and mispriced with an activist catalyst okay that was july 2019 what's it done since
1:15:20
then down 40 percent right up here buckley capital management
1:15:30
investment advisor focused on value investing with a concentration in small cap okay welcome welcome buckley capital to the
1:15:36
roaring kitty live stream okay combine a long bias value oriented approach with a relentless discipline
1:15:41
okay so i like this right that's that that's good and then um do you have
1:15:50
performance no performance bummer team
1:15:56
zach buckley analyst for baker street capital that one sounds familiar baker street chief operating officer
1:16:05
background and i think it's a small firm team is that it all right so they don't
1:16:11
have much and then what's the last thing what else do you check um oh any other research and other companies no other research another cut
1:16:17
that carries huh what oh sorry i meant to do uh
1:16:26
what
1:16:32
oh they got a bunch so then this is good to do so you pull up you come across nautical right and then you can just do what other
1:16:38
articles have they written and then you can read some of their especially if it's a company you're dialed into and then you can see how they viewed it
1:16:43
at that time and you can use it as a way to um to uh to calibrate or do they know
1:16:49
what they're talking about for this other company or maybe they missed something obvious back in the day well how did it turn out for them even if it's company you weren't dialed into
1:16:57
but usually i'm just looking at the names that they invested in previously like for for example if i saw someone
1:17:03
who's just like they wrote a whole bunch of articles that are like what's a value invested thing that's not my style like uh like short tests or
1:17:10
something right a lot of investors like that's a turn off for me because first of all i don't i've thought i've
1:17:15
long felt that was a bad trade a really risky trade and um
1:17:20
and i just feel like time is better spent elsewhere like on smaller cap equities and so forth and so i like when
1:17:25
i see names like that type of value investing where someone's actually writing some fundamental analysis on smaller companies as opposed to big
1:17:31
value type plays or even like the most commonly covered companies like apple you can see a ton
1:17:37
of articles on apple and stuff so that's the type of thing i like to see it's just a way you know what it takes
1:17:43
two minutes it takes two minutes to pull up their articles and search their name and look for their background what their expertise is what
1:17:48
the team is i never heard of this one and then you track so much that you get a feel for the the common authors but that was a
1:17:54
new one i hadn't seen before and they were very bullish and blah blah blah but i don't recognize any other research
1:18:00
though i don't even know these companies interviews a lot of china stuff
1:18:06
a lot of interviews a lot of interviews back in the day four value trades and large caps see there's an example that was 2010 maybe they've changed
1:18:13
their ways short seller tactics health insurance i'm not getting a feel for this this isn't kind of my style of um
1:18:20
investing here it doesn't mean they're wrong about select interior but uh
1:18:26
high mo non-cyclical business
1:18:32
form via merger of two drive a share price of 11 i believe investors are offered the most asymmetrical
1:18:37
wow so that's kind of changed down 40 since then secondary most important valuable asset
1:18:43
is asg all right now i'm kind of intrigued here the company recently announced strategic alternatives
1:18:50
after a push from act oh that's a different activist adw capital do they still own it
1:19:01
pulling up just checking out the def in 2020 this is where i'll do a quick check of
1:19:07
the beneficial owners are they are they not even owners
1:19:14
anymore that activist group how could they not be owners this was
1:19:19
this was last year asg adw capital really can't be you're kidding
1:19:25
me
1:19:30
let me just is there an older one i can pull up let's pause 2019 are they here
1:19:36
oh they sold out interesting oh and b-rock so b riley
1:19:44
in gateway were already big big holders of this company and adw was the activist you know what i mean
1:19:49
like what's going on here and then we're trying to develop a narrative they were bigger holders they owned a quarter of the company these gateway
1:19:55
security and b riley and adw was the one trying to mix things
1:20:00
up kind of weird
1:20:06
here's their announcement we lost it it was on yahoo okay
1:20:11
um and adw is out now you know what i mean like maybe they were maybe they didn't like what they see that's weird because if you're aligned
1:20:17
with some other investors like b riley and the other one gateway why don't you stick around can't they
1:20:22
get involved and start you get enough equity you get your own 30 of the company whatever so that makes me think
1:20:27
maybe they didn't like what they were seeing oh there's a lot that was said no because that was that def was on april 20th or roughly
1:20:34
you know what i mean so much happened this year i can't like i've been saying i don't blame anyone for selling out of their positions in q1 and q2 just
1:20:40
because so much stuff was moving there's plenty of other opportunities out there um
1:20:46
but okay most valuable important value loss there's asg the company stoned stone distribution business it's an
1:20:52
importer importer exporter importer exporter ice is one of the highest quality
1:20:58
distribution business i've ever come across wow that's high moat business
1:21:05
benefits of scale and the logistically complex stone distribution there's other stone through other stone
1:21:10
um building products companies i'm pretty sure one of isn't the ticker rock is that a bold claim i don't think so
1:21:16
gibraltar or something gibraltar steel
1:21:25
what's their business they do rock or is it just the ticker you know what i mean
1:21:32
manufacturers have building products operations renewable energy conservation residential products
1:21:38
rocks any rocks no all right so i just got thrown off by the ticker all right um i don't know if i really
1:21:45
feel like reading any more of this i don't know what the upside is who's
1:21:50
commenting on anyone commenting on like i kind of i kind of need to see more than this i don't want to read i could read articles all day you know
1:21:55
what i mean you need to have some um oh look at this some comments on this this was just oh so the adw now holds
1:22:01
exactly zero shares as of december 2019. so they sold out before
1:22:06
uh this year there you go so that's uh that's that's a little bit concerning to me because you had some equity support uh some some
1:22:14
um shareholder support from other people who had a good chunk b riley in particular and they still they're like nah this
1:22:19
ain't gonna work out and got out
1:22:31
i could have sworn solace capitalism some other stuff all right but anyway we see they have
1:22:37
control they have control of this company these two b riley um and gateway securities
1:22:43
holdings whoever they are number eight i don't i've never seen them before oh that's solace i've seen solace before
1:22:49
so they're they're not hidden but they're they're it's a different fun maybe that owns them i'm not usually aligned with these folks
1:22:56
this could be a successful investment but um i think i'm gonna pass on this and not dig in any deeper
1:23:02
for better or worse watch it'll double and then you'll be seeing me i'll be adding it to the the missed opportunity list oh yeah do i
1:23:09
still have that oh yeah i still have that i gotta add more to this well hopefully prt isn't why it's not a
1:23:14
forever missed opportunity list ah there's so many more to add to this um matador was one
1:23:21
and uh tentacle a little bit because i get that stop-loss issue remember that
1:23:28
did i say kirk i did say kirk is that there's like there's like three or four other oh michael's i mean
1:23:34
michael's i got in the portfolio right there's a couple others right
1:23:39
no i can't remember we'll add more okay all right let's keep going keep
1:23:46
going clean it up clean it up um okay all right
1:23:54
now we where we get open look at this 820 yes we could do whatever the hell we want we
1:23:59
can do whatever we want what do we want to do
1:24:08
is the daily with the dash all right let me just check out the dash here let's go let's keep going over to the
1:24:13
buy list that's something that we haven't done in a while huh most of these buy lists are um most of
1:24:20
these companies in the buy list are currently in the portfolio so we're probably already dialed into them but there was almost like a good reminder see this is kind of clunky what am i
1:24:26
gonna do pull this up every time i it's hard maintaining this list
1:24:32
and keeping your eye on it it's like just kind of clunky what's c dev doing by the way
1:24:39
this one looked interesting who's inside of mine oh it's gonna be this could be a good time to add what do you think
1:24:47
yeah yeah yeah what do you think of this one
1:24:55
oh now i'm happy i got this here i am [ __ ] on it and i'm like oh damn clutch i forgot about that one
1:25:04
oh yeah clipper realty didn't they have a lot of insider buying
1:25:11
they did look at that a ton wow this has been has this been in there that long
1:25:16
they bought 900k just below six chairman of the board too
1:25:22
realty but i was just like not that my guy
1:25:28
anyone own that's right so some of these we can look we can look at these with a new lens because we can pull up
1:25:33
with funds we're holding it as of june 30th same 11 oh someone's got control is he
1:25:38
he's the one who bought oh [ __ ] he's the one who bought he's got control of the company he bought more i mean as a percentage of his ownership
1:25:45
it's a fraction of it you see what i mean um he's owns 50 of the company is that
1:25:52
real and i see two bistros okay so is this like family control is that what this is
1:26:06
hmm
1:26:13
oh wow sam levinson 20 all executives and
1:26:19
directors all right they own 37 they're in that's a good chunk 37 is good chunk you
1:26:26
want the more the better generally speaking um and then you see this five percent they look at the see how the family they
1:26:32
got control of this [ __ ]
1:26:37
for great american financial group forward signature into i don't know any of these
1:26:43
names though huh bistro search all right so it's their
1:26:48
company all right let's pull that one up too
1:26:56
because it's not in the portfolio we haven't seen that name yet
1:27:04
pull that up cnr i added to that just in time oh bait text we just added to this too okay what's
1:27:09
this one doing just bobbing around bobbing around
1:27:15
bobbing around you know what i mean so i've been trimming some of this energy position but this is the type that i might add a little bit more into
1:27:20
we know that buffett just added that small position in suncor you know what i mean i was talking about how
1:27:26
someone like him such a long-term investor you think he'd just be like i'm done with oil sands but he's still dabbling even right now so that's at
1:27:32
least a tad bullish for me for that industry uh much better longer term thinker than i am
1:27:39
asps oh this one's bouncing back huh
1:27:44
this one's bouncing back this was the one we were looking at we were getting yeah that's right did i did i ever add
1:27:51
to this oh [ __ ] i can't remember we looked at this a couple other streams ago so this is a
1:27:56
good opportunity let me check this off again this one and
1:28:01
what was the uh in resi res i remember they were like uh both tied at
1:28:07
the hip yeah yeah yeah i think we might add to
1:28:12
this one okay asps okay let's go through here
1:28:21
okay i get those pull up any others to pull up bte nah cnr no cvgi that one's it's hanging in
1:28:26
there right i keep on waiting for it to pull back it's already a big position but ah it's going to hang up there damn
1:28:32
you never know what's dvd doing i have this in a different portfolio a different account that still looks
1:28:39
good i was looking to trim it but i'm just like oh it still looks good did they do the dbd does um
1:28:45
um atm machines like the what's it called uh oh die bold right there you see it in their name
1:28:51
die bold nick's door for something it's a foreign company i think it's a foreign company makes
1:28:56
dwarf it's got to be um but super leveraged super leveraged and it was always i
1:29:03
looked at it in 2018 and then i crushed it i don't think i bought i don't think i bought it though
1:29:09
then it pulled back and then i used this as an opportunity i'm like all right i'll put i'll put some back on it's kind of looks then they were buying
1:29:15
too weren't they buying should i be adding to this now they're not buying much
1:29:21
they're buying in march though like to see that right you like to see that [ __ ] by in march you know what i mean
1:29:26
not that much though is anyone talking about it i should have that link to seeking alpha right there
1:29:39
i don't know who that is damian roberts
1:29:45
i don't recognize any of these folks all right what's this this is when they
1:29:51
uh did they pop they've they raised their full year free cash flow outlook see
1:29:56
if there are a company like this i'd be like did i think they may have did they turn over their management team that you need to see because you need to be more
1:30:01
of a deleveraging state um they expect free cash flow of 20 to 30 million
1:30:07
all right so this is something they actually gave a forecast they said 20 to 2 to 30 million um
1:30:14
and they don't have if you're so leveraged though is that true free casual you know what i mean you got to
1:30:19
make sure you have enough generally speaking to eventually pay off the debt you got to cover interest costs so of course this should at least cut
1:30:26
can um take into account interest payments um they were previously forecasting
1:30:33
break even so now they're forecasting much higher than they previously did um okay report uh report required record
1:30:42
record quarterly adjusted ebitda what they reported record i mean adjusted
1:30:47
ebitda right non-gaap gross margin and about whoa [ __ ]
1:30:54
and q2 what adjusted ebitda rose 15 year-over-year
1:31:00
how can that be atms it's atms right gross margin was 27 up from 24 in last
1:31:08
year's quarter oh we gotta look into this doesn't couldn't this be a big doesn't this have a lot of upside too
1:31:15
they they bought a lot in 2018 didn't they they bought a [ __ ] yeah they bought a [ __ ] ton this is what i remember i remember that
1:31:20
the stock price bottom and then they went boom boom boom boom buying a ton in 2019.
1:31:25
that price is higher than this at prices higher than this look at this um i need a damn highlighter i need to circle
1:31:32
stuff you know what i mean even that damn cat even if i have this thing oh that's evernote i thought that
1:31:37
was my uh did i reboot the computer
1:31:45
this would be something all right i turn this up i have this but this isn't this is kind of funny but
1:31:53
is it useful is it useful because that's not enough i need to be able to adjust the size and stuff that i want to circle on
1:31:58
circle um but here you go there you go this is because i want to show that it
1:32:04
doesn't matter who cares but uh they were buying a [ __ ] ton here's the gist let me save you the trouble
1:32:10
they're uh they're buying hundreds hundreds of thousands uh in 2018 but more in 2019 at prices
1:32:16
well above this nines and tens and then they went a little bit a little bit quiet then they
1:32:22
started buying more late last year same it looks like a lot of the same dude all rich maher
1:32:30
oh this is his biggest purchase when was that november of 2019. oh i didn't buy any more this year that's too bad
1:32:38
and they're not buying quite as much these days but yeah see they've pulled back on there inside of buying but still but still
1:32:47
oh [ __ ] uh so they crushed in q2 huh not to not too many companies did right and it's all adjusted right this isn't clean
1:32:53
but i don't care to the extent that i care about they reported
1:32:59
like beats in year-over-year improvements compared to other companies that remember what company did we just look
1:33:04
at it was a fossil down 48 year-over-year like 48 what the hell is going on
1:33:10
um all right so yeah okay well what can i say i gotta look into this
1:33:16
i wish there was more insider buying and does there anyone own it
1:33:26
oh [ __ ] bill miller son of a [ __ ]
1:33:31
ah bill miller there you go this is his is this his personal trust he's i i crossed paths with bill miller
1:33:38
a bit i think i and i also notice i i didn't read much bill miller when i
1:33:45
was younger although i think he has some famous books out but i he i have a little bit in common with him and that i remember him being like
1:33:52
like bullish on bitcoin right and i'm bullish on bitcoin strictly strictly from a technical
1:33:57
analyst standpoint you know what i mean like value investors like i can't value a blah blah blah and it's a bubble and all this stuff they may be right but
1:34:04
just from a technical analyst point i think it's it's me trying to diverse my skill sets
1:34:09
right what the hell is bitcoin doing again oh yes i added that so i can just type
1:34:14
it like and how many value investors have said that they're bullish on bitcoin you know what i mean i forget when he said it he actually said it much
1:34:20
earlier than i did because i don't remember he may have said it years ago
1:34:34
he's still he said it's gonna is that real is that random out this is a random ass youtube video
1:34:40
i don't know if that did he realize it's gonna be 300 000
1:34:46
still a bill on june oh so he's bullish too i didn't i hadn't i haven't been tracking um he or disney
1:34:53
uh aren't they long game stop actually that's not true they uh run uh miller value partners and i came across um something that they
1:35:00
had written because he was bullish on game sub two for the very same simplistic uh things that you can come
1:35:06
across on the thesis right and you think he's so he's so great and everything like that so he must have a more complex thesis or
1:35:12
maybe no one thinks that i'm making that up but and it's like yeah that's the thesis that's it i feel like bill miller keeps it simple
1:35:17
but maybe he's more bullish for mom is he more bullish on it from a uh
1:35:23
a use case i'm not i have no clue oh okay so he's bullshitting for different reasons
1:35:30
it looks like i don't know damn i just wanted to see that i could have sworn he but years ago so
1:35:35
this is all 20 20. it's all new stuff but didn't he talk about it like back in the day here you go belizean book legendary cio
1:35:40
invest 50 what this is what i'm talking about
1:35:46
is this real did he invest 50 of his money invested in bitcoin recently stayed on the podcast
1:35:52
wealthtrack oh that's a legit podcast isn't it wealthtrack that are on half the money from his hedge funds middle of our partners or
1:35:58
1.1 billion is currently investment there you go who the hell who does that that's that's who that's
1:36:03
nuts right that's not bill miller you may not know this but that's that's uh don't confuse yourself that's not
1:36:09
bill muller um 50 i'm not that bullish dude i mean this
1:36:16
was back in the day right and this also this was uh december 2017. so it may have been after a huge run-up where it went up
1:36:22
gigantic maybe he was leveraged to maybe had some options on it um and it was up big just like i think
1:36:29
that's what's happening with barry's portfolio with those google calls i think he just timed right and they just they're up 10x or
1:36:34
100x or whatever the hell it is and uh maybe that's what happened with bill miller but see what i mean who does what value investors do this and he was
1:36:41
i don't i don't know if he was ridiculed but probably in the value world they're probably like what the hell
1:36:47
50 though does he really did he really believe in it
1:36:54
what do you have to say about it what we're studying is ways we can mitigate risk to the overall fundamental it won't
1:36:59
be 50 of the fund for that much longer which does not mean necessarily that we're going to be selling it
1:37:04
all right okay i mean just this is just me being curious like stuff like that and i remember thinking all right they don't see many valuables talk like that
1:37:10
but then there's been other companies too not even uh forget the gamestop one um i came across that by chance that i
1:37:16
saw he was invested in gamestop right [ __ ]
1:37:28
nothing recent yeah i don't care um but um so wow so he's in this one did he and he
1:37:34
just he just added this he's a 10 from july 2020
1:37:39
and i'm pretty sure this is his uh his is that not his family trust i think it's his family trust because miller value partners is what you would say
1:37:46
quad so quad he and i um he went he went heavy into quad uh late february
1:37:52
february 20th or something and it was for his you'll see it right there
1:38:01
right here mil will miller william trust um any um what was that february february
1:38:08
20th now that um anybody owns 89 and so this is a super leveraged company but legitimate
1:38:14
cash flows and they used to pay a dividend so it's controlled by this family the quadratic quadratus or something and then there's
1:38:20
another one too that not many other people own but he owned it and i'm like ah because i had questions about credit risk i'm like if
1:38:25
he does it i'm sure he makes mistakes right it's not like it's a definite win but i i i take notice and i i have i like
1:38:34
that company bill miller i he's a famous wasn't he like buffett talks him up too like mason he's like
1:38:39
mason right uh [ __ ] so this is we got something we
1:38:44
got something here oh 32 percent of his portfolio so let me just check this again there you go i
1:38:50
mean of the reported portfolio within his trust right this nuance to take into consideration here
1:38:56
but okay so let's check this though the market value oh he has a huge position of pitney bowes really what's he doing
1:39:06
penny bows they aren't they don't do them he's done a lot of these like cat these
1:39:12
companies are all that's new august 3rd he just fouled the
1:39:18
13g i missed these oh there's miller value partners right there oh sorry you can't see it
1:39:24
right there that's his uh from i think i think i'm not that i'm this is
1:39:30
i looked at it i looked into it once and you can actually see their holdings although one time i swear i did this i didn't i didn't see gamestop then i'm
1:39:35
like do i have the right i just want to check like i like i've been thinking that this is his fund
1:39:42
i mean it has to be i know it is but uh oh gamestop is there and he trimmed it a little bit it's just
1:39:47
that's what caught my attention because they had written on it but it was such a small percentage of the portfolio but maybe it changed
1:39:52
no that's really small um so that's the fund wait is it in the
1:39:58
fund it should be enough but why is that's what i mean like oh dvd is in the fund
1:40:04
wait where are we okay dvd is one of their top positions in the fund and they bought more in q2
1:40:11
they bought more in q2 see this two they bought 240k they were they increased their position
1:40:20
eight percent and what about um pitney bowe and pitney bowes right here pity bows right below
1:40:26
so he's got it in his so that's the thing so he invests in the fun and then he also i think that i'm pretty sure it's his personal trust
1:40:32
family trust or something then he goes all right this is gonna go in my family's trust as well and they're like huge cash flow
1:40:37
generators but risky and oh man there's a lot of overlap here
1:40:47
quotient technology i don't even know some of these names i should i am i not tracking i need to attract
1:40:52
this is this in my uh funds that i so i oh that's something we could do today oh

1:41:42
asps all right let's oh yeah cdv because is that one worth adding hold on just quick i just needed to see
1:41:48
the insider buy i don't think they've added since june on this
1:41:55
may there was this firm that was adding in may below a dollar and now we're below we're below the
1:42:01
price that they were adding at you know what i mean see that [ __ ]
1:42:07
[ __ ] did anyone talk about this hold on we'll come back we'll come back to dvd [ __ ] um
1:42:17
anyone say anything about this but i should also check i don't have twitter linked here but we should check on twitter for something like this there's
1:42:22
probably not going to be many people talking about it so small
1:42:29
[ __ ] not much all right damn
1:42:36
i just want to close out of this i just want to do some quick checks before i do oh did you did you also see without i
1:42:42
just thought of this come on i don't think we'll get to dvd but there was a gamestop article posted today
1:42:47
while i'm doing this and they were talking about options um which i liked the new angle um it was
1:42:53
a decent article too they were talking about the um some of the risks related to the stock
1:42:58
and for the most part it was it was on point who the hell is this company the riverstone hall riverstone holdings
1:43:06
i don't know any of the other funds what is this again cdf i'm all over the place i'm talking about like five things at
1:43:12
once no one owns it except for this fund who the hell are they
1:43:25
oh trippy trippy it's kind of cool huh hey let's just
1:43:32
chill let's just kick back watch this [ __ ] a nice that's not a bad website huh i
1:43:39
don't know what they do but
1:43:45
how about founded in 2000 so been around right there have you been around a while
1:43:50
you know what i mean if you're a new fund you're like yeah okay but you've been around a while you've seen some things you've seen some [ __ ] just found it in 2000 wow oh you know
1:43:57
what i did i mentioned i've just i'm watching the sopranos right now um i haven't somehow haven't seen the sopranos before and uh it's it's it's
1:44:05
it's it's cool because that first season or the second season it's like 99 2000 and they're like it's like tech tech bubble time and like
1:44:11
one of the episodes is dedicated to uh carmelo like getting involved in investing and stuff like that and it's interesting because it was it
1:44:18
aired like in march and april right as the tech bubble was was um peaking and stuff and so it's kind of
1:44:24
and they had a a chop shop and then one of the episodes too a couple of the episodes anyway it
1:44:29
was just kind of interesting and speaking of 2000 because i checked the date that it was released i thought oh that's sick
1:44:35
since inception we've raised over 40 billion all right uh what do you do though what's your strategy
1:44:41
platform investment strategies ability to invest across subsectors and capital
1:44:46
structure globally since we've built in four investment platforms what the hell
1:44:54
i don't know well i don't know what they do it looks like they it looks like they're legitimate they're not some um
1:45:05
it looks like they're real they're real fun they're real firm um i have no idea we can see their other
1:45:11
holdings that could be helpful let's do that [ __ ] there's no holdings oh [ __ ]
1:45:18
what else they got iniva talos i do know talos and look at you so they take this
1:45:24
is the thing that's what stood out to me now i remember because so far i haven't found anything i'm like i don't know anything they own 30 percent of the company
1:45:31
they own 30 percent but do they own the debt too how much debt does cde have because if they own the debt
1:45:40
do they have publicly traded debt i don't think they do ah what's the name
1:45:48
of the company centennial resource development
1:45:53
wait a second what was the name of that company
1:45:59
didn't they have centennial in their name
1:46:07
oh [ __ ] is it one in the same what's going on
1:46:14
what's this is that the same thing
1:46:21
oh [ __ ]
1:46:26
is it like their own is it their own their own company that did they take it
1:46:33
public and uh their private equity firm too right but they're buying back more
1:46:40
looks this looks terrible look at this chart still looks terrible
1:46:47
oh [ __ ] what are they doing
1:46:54
what do you do what do you do here what do you do um
1:47:00
did i x out of that yeah here we go i still got it oh that was sick shift command t shift command t bring it back up i kind
1:47:07
of want to see um la payer oh i looked up this before and i remember thinking is this the same guy
1:47:12
from uh oh from uh that ticker oi
1:47:20
or io because la pierre is it the same name
1:47:27
spelled a little bit differently but i remember looking into it these people related do they have some experience does this family have experience i don't think
1:47:33
they're related i think i looked it up but thought it might have been the same guy um
1:47:38
[ __ ] what am i looking for here i want to see um like do they list centennial is it their
1:47:44
own company that's what i'm trying to the ego so see this a 20 year history of investing across the entire energy value
1:47:49
chain globally key facts portfolio company since inception this is one of their portfolio
1:47:55
companies is it is that their name centennial in there i don't know damn it what to do what to do what to do
1:48:03
well let's pull the fundamentals just real quick i'm not i'm not going to forget we're looking at a dvd i wanted to
1:48:09
asps keep that up
1:48:18
let me close out of the universe i'm about to slow down the damn stream quad i haven't seen anything happening
1:48:25
on quad that was my thing
1:48:32
all right what the hell is it here
1:48:38
there it is see what we got it's in the portfolio so i definitely i liked what i
1:48:44
saw let's see what i saw i saw the insider bye i saw the chart look terrible sometimes
1:48:51
terrible isn't always a i mean terrible is often a bad thing but to get in the portfolio you're at your ad and
1:48:56
you're adding to uh like you're initiating a position when the chart looks terrible as a value investor
1:49:02
that tends to be what you're doing right it's like it looks terribly like you got to step in because that's often when it's the cheapest and then then he bounces back and pulls back and
1:49:08
blah blah blah but you usually step it in and then you can you can build into the position as as things unfold either as
1:49:15
time passes or as the price gets cheaper although if you're buying as the price gets cheaper you need to be damn sure
1:49:21
you need to be sure on the balance sheet you need to be sure it's strong in the business model and stuff like that
1:49:27
but that's often when you make the most money is that when you buy in like when the chart looks ugly and stuff but then it
1:49:32
keeps getting cheaper but because you have high conviction you can keep averaging down but oftentimes you shouldn't average
1:49:37
down it's like it's a tough call it just depends on the type of position anyway so as time passes though like
1:49:43
with gamestop like uh like the games that it's been doing nothing for like 12 months right now this is either a tremendous
1:49:48
opportunity to have been adding over time which is what i've been doing um or it's this is it it's never gonna
1:49:54
bounce again right and then it's like yeah whatever but um what you can also be doing is adding as the price starts rising so i kind of
1:50:00
like part of me is almost like i see this chart right it's like a good like it's kind of basing here a little bit it's a good opportunity to add right here
1:50:06
but i might add again i kind of want to wait for it to like break out like i see this with pbf right now like pbf is a top it's already a top
1:50:14
position what is it i um i need a link i need a link that gets me right back to the rory kitty
1:50:19
portfolio at all times i hate scrolling uh pbf is uh number 10. it's top 10
1:50:25
position and it hasn't done anything right and i i want to add more because this like this is what i'm talking about i see this i'm like time
1:50:30
to add time dad and i did add in july i already added um but it's time to date again but now
1:50:36
i'm just like well something's gonna happen this is what they talk about um like dead money you've got capital you've got precious
1:50:42
capital in your hands do you want to put it in a stock that might just be doing nothing for a while now the value investor in
1:50:48
you is like who cares who cares if it does not for a while blah blah blah and that's a fair point but um um if other things look more
1:50:55
compelling unless thing looks super compelling you know pbf i think it's like a double or triple it doesn't look crazy like five
1:51:01
bagger compelling but um and it's already a big position so it's like hard to justify continuing to
1:51:08
add until i'm like all right just break out already um i mean it didn't really break out here this was everything
1:51:14
was breaking out at this time right excuse me geez maybe maybe this beer will help me with that
1:51:21
so that's what i see with c c dev too same thing it's kind of leveling off here plus the energy's been looking kind of weak but
1:51:27
it seems to be holding up okay we've seen some shitty energy some shitty looking energy charts but this seems okay
1:51:34
and then okay so what did i see in the fundamentals look at this okay so look at this it's
1:51:40
76 cents 76 cents okay let's try this 76 cents this is i know you can't see it
1:51:47
but that's this is stupid that this is a tangible book value of ten dollars like what
1:51:54
what and so you see this uh you see a lit up real revenues too 769 in revenues that's this is a real energy company
1:52:00
even though you think penny stock right 76 cents but this isn't uh many of my energy positions many a good
1:52:08
a good a number of them are much smaller than this i think that could be a bold claim i'm not sure but so you see this tangible book to
1:52:15
price right here uh trades at 13 the book value is 13 times larger than the price right now so if you invert
1:52:21
that which i always need to gotta grab the graphing calculator for this i always forget that's about seven percent seven
1:52:26
percent of book now yeah what is these energy companies book value is always suspect right
1:52:31
that goes hand in hand but what was i saying this with entero resources trades at a fraction of its book and
1:52:37
again you'd say well that's because book has it should be written down and it hasn't been yet but if you're trading at seven
1:52:42
percent of book unless the book is gonna be wiped out you're you're trading at a discount and
1:52:47
i think entero is like trades at like three or four bucks and it's got book value of like 20 or 24 bucks you know what i mean trading at 20
1:52:53
of book value write it down write it down but you'd still be tradable a book
1:52:58
doesn't mean the thesis can be that simple there's other variables that play here but when i see that and i see this this is very clearly what i saw
1:53:04
this is june 30th 2020 it's up to date oh it's another quarterly thing here oh
1:53:09
[Applause] i'm gonna have to i'm gonna end up doing this over time i'll just
1:53:14
oh this sucks i'll do i'll do it off stream excuse me sorry
1:53:21
the lawn mower the lawnmower got me i'll do it off stream or i'll fix this it'll take me it will take me 10 minutes
1:53:27
but it's uh the tedious work is starting to get to me
1:53:33
ah [ __ ] oh i forgot the quote
1:53:41
at least at least it fixed this quick i think it should fix quick
1:53:46
oh [ __ ] come on what did i do
1:53:55
i fixed it didn't i
1:54:01
oh sorry sorry sorry sorry precious time precious time
1:54:08
equals baba let me try this one equals quote quote
1:54:15
boom got it let's do it
1:54:24
there we go okay so we don't okay so this is this is um looks a tad more not precarious but
1:54:30
carrie's not the right word but i have a i have a shorter history to work with um it increases the risk increases the risk
1:54:35
i got 20 years of history i feel much more comfortable with the position um especially with an energy
1:54:40
company so this is like a growth type energy company it's like really in the early stages getting getting walloped here
1:54:46
um a bit with everything that's happened in the energy industry over the whole post past 12 months look at the share
1:54:54
you see the share current rise them but now it's kind of flat-lined um this must be their company is it their company and they took it public
1:54:59
it's good that they're buying [ __ ] if they weren't buying i sure wish they were buying right now
1:55:05
but again so much going on okay look at this ebitda too look at this sorry and i can't see ebitda
1:55:11
um almost two bucks two bucks so it's pretty i mean this one
1:55:16
i mean it's too bad we can't find a dam no bonds i know they got bonds
1:55:23
i tried that always because i typed it in what if i do this way
1:55:29
that's it right centennial resource is that does it get resource in the name centennial resource development centennial resource production
1:55:38
yeah that's it oh look at the okay so it's trading in the 40s right now
1:55:44
sick all right let me just change that i just want to get it down to
1:55:54
so they have some wow that's not that i mean that's bad right 40s are bad 40s you're being priced for
1:56:00
bankruptcy but those those are in 2027. that's bad but it's not it's not awful
1:56:06
the yield is 25 you know what i mean that's not it's not 50 or 100 it's bad but
1:56:16
what's the what's the bomb price has been doing holy toledo look at this it was that par at the beginning of the share par
1:56:22
so that's a good sign right it's not like it was trending downward over the past couple years it's been crushed wow
1:56:29
100 oh this is not a bad setup this isn't bad
1:56:36
they went from 23 to 60 back down to 40
1:56:47
which is still well above where it was okay and how about the other one i'm going to
1:56:52
say the same thing right 20 27
1:57:01
all right okay i um and both value now i'm both value not
1:57:07
doing great but look at the look at this look at this so look at these metroid it was did it really earn 63 cents and 29
1:57:13
cents just a couple years ago and so now it's just a question of the debt and the debt
1:57:18
okay now we got to look at the balance sheet what else can i say
1:57:27
[Music] what is this stuff notice how effective
1:57:35
what was it what did they do
1:57:40
[ __ ] this looks interesting doesn't it i know i mean it's like scary cheap you know what i mean
1:57:46
but those bonds are still only in the fort what is it that they did they what is it s3 did they issues did they issue some
1:57:52
securities what'd they do oh they're about to be delisted [ __ ]
1:57:58
what are they gonna do has no immediate effect on the listing
1:58:05
they have until february 18th to regain compliance all right so what's the plan reverse who care what does it matter reverse split i
1:58:11
always intends to actively monitor the closing bid and will evaluate available options
1:58:16
to regain compliance ah [ __ ] oh it trades on the nasdaq
1:58:21
for an energy company
1:58:28
they're in the delaware basin okay that's a little bit more of a core delaware basin pure play not a
1:58:36
total expert it's a sub basin of the permian based in the west's okay
1:58:41
it's just a question now it's just a question of um or does anyone want does anyone like these reserves like remember
1:58:47
when we're looking at sandridge so sandridge remember that story of uh like carl icahn getting involved in stuff and people were apparently bidding
1:58:54
on those assets people wanted them back in the day and that conveys to me that not
1:58:59
necessarily higher quality assets but that people wanted them and if people want them then there's a potential for a buyout then i don't know if that's likely with
1:59:05
sandridge but it increases the chances that it's worth quite a bit more than its current uh current price point um but at least
1:59:13
there's a story there i don't really have much of a story yet i don't know i'm not an expert on the delaware basin per se
1:59:18
if i if someone would make it a bid but they're the fact that the insiders are buying you know it's a little bit of a story because they're like this is
1:59:23
probably crazy cheap and we see the prices and the fundamentals but um oh they got a presentation
1:59:30
sick oh let's do this because those look that looks scary cheap when i see something like that that's what i mean like sometimes we'll come across a
1:59:36
company in these daily movers and stuff i'm like yeah it looks interesting like like fossil for example i'm like we dug into
1:59:42
it a little bit but i'm like i'm not going to pencil through because what is going to be a double or something but this this is like five dagger potential then
1:59:48
i'm like let's do it all right so this was their q2 release
1:59:55
on august 3rd how did the stock price react
2:00:01
it popped and now it's back down sick it popped a little bit right 80 cents to
2:00:08
90 cents come on call that a pop okay uh what would they say
2:00:14
reduced cat-backs no [ __ ] um lou implemented plant
2:00:21
executed dead exchange they did a dead exchange sick seeing so many dead exchanges without these companies right to if you you just won't want it to be
2:00:28
done already right reducing total senior note debt by oh did they do it at discounted prices do
2:00:33
they do it at a discounted prices sec that's what got us involved with uh not involved with i already had it in
2:00:39
the portfolio but um why we added to forum to fet fet um
2:00:46
where's all their press releases come on oh if they if they were able to wipe out some debt at discount prices
2:00:51
here we go commencement of exchange offers and consents oh [ __ ] so they did it do i miss this
2:00:58
for any and all outstanding senior students oh [ __ ] that's these are the bonds we're just looking at this was in april oh right in
2:01:04
the heat of it you know what i mean tough environment if you feel for the who was it bait tax remember bait bte
2:01:10
they were they um not a bond exchange but they refinanced in january right before everything collapsed you're like
2:01:16
whoo just in time but all these other firms gamestop included it's like how did you not take care of this
2:01:22
already ah here we go to exchange any and all their outstanding
2:01:27
seniors to 2026. those are still outstanding though right
2:01:33
yeah that's them so there's still some outstanding maybe known um with the other um
2:01:41
exchange these ones and together with the old 2026 those for up to right to any and all they're outstanding
2:01:46
in the 2026 notes and the 2027 notes for up to 250 million aggregate principal amount of newly issued eight
2:01:52
percent second lien notes senior court are those outstanding
2:01:58
other is this sound wait what does it do dude 20 25 8 that's them so they're
2:02:05
trading there we go and they traded 84.
2:02:10
but they got it done they got some of them done the fact that we still see uh ratings and prices on these
2:02:16
not everyone not everyone exchanged
2:02:25
okay here we go aggregate outstanding principal amount like i want to see early exchange considering if tendered and not
2:02:31
withdrawn total principal amount of new notes
2:02:38
look at this so they got the hair 50 haircut so there was a thousand dollar principal amount for the
2:02:43
previous bonds and they're saying they're saying if you do the early consideration well we'll um we'll give you 500 of the
2:02:50
new notes so uh i believe they're wiping out half of the debt and they're kind of um
2:02:56
but the reason you might do it if you're a bondholder right is because well you don't want to get zero you don't you might not want to go into bankruptcy sometimes you do it just depends
2:03:02
um but this is a way for these bond exchanges these distressed bot exchange bond exchanges are a way for companies to
2:03:11
buy back the debt refinance at discount prices and the bondholders take a haircut i mean the shareholders have taken a
2:03:17
haircut too right but now there's potential for upside
2:03:23
and then if you do the late exchange they offered 450. we saw forum energy fet did it at what price they did
2:03:28
it like 35 to 40. so they they were able to do it at even bigger discounts um
2:03:35
okay so they did that and then how much how much was tendered they said up to 250 total though right
2:03:41
for up to 250 million of aggregate principles so they were never there was no way they were going to exhaust because there was
2:03:47
this 900 there's 900 900 million oh that's a lot isn't it
2:03:53
almost a billion in debt can i see these total figures aggregate figures uh what i'm gonna look
2:03:59
at is uh scroll over oh good and i want to see this total debt column right here
2:04:05
there you go yeah they had a billion oh now they're up to a billion as of june 30th
2:04:11
that's all doesn't that just seem like you have a billion in debt and you have 770 million in revenues not
2:04:18
free cash flow not earnings revenues and of course the thinking here is that revenues are going to grow
2:04:24
as energy prices right but that's like a good um like a metric like revenues to total debt it's like ah you don't even
2:04:30
have enough revenues to cover your debt just one year i get that right but it's just a rule of thumb that catches my i have it i have it here for one of my
2:04:38
metrics i have it yeah it's right here so um remember this calculator i showed in one
2:04:44
of my videos but revenues to net common overhang this isn't just total debt this is all long-term liabilities plus
2:04:50
short-term debt um and look at it's lit up red see that stuck out to me
2:04:56
ugh that's a lot of debt that's a lot of debt how much did they exchange let's see
2:05:02
let's back out of this so that's when they announced it right announced it's extension of early tender
2:05:09
date that's what gamestop had to do too they would they're like hoping people announce determination announces
2:05:15
expiration announces settlement this will just jump to this this was a
2:05:20
so a month passed announced the the final settlement of
2:05:26
the previously announced exchange offers whereby crp crp
2:05:33
centennial resource production the it's operating subsidiary yeah these companies they got all the look if
2:05:39
you look in there 10k you see all the operating structure and stuff they're all over the place with the names okay uh what what was the conclusion
2:05:46
secondly and secure notes due 20 25 and up to i'm sorry i'm not reading too fast for
2:05:52
myself for up to 250 million of the aggregate principle second lien senior notes
2:05:57
due 2025 and up to of new eight percent due toning and up
2:06:03
to 200 million aggregate principal amount of newly issued eight percent third lean senior news secured notes to
2:06:09
2027 are those out there
2:06:18
is that these ones oh i missed that in the first one
2:06:23
oh that's that no that can't be those ones can it why would it go back to 2019 is
2:06:31
this it hmm all right well what's the conclusion
2:06:37
here i mentioned accepted tender offers rolls from 110 million aggregate principle
2:06:43
of old 200 of 2026 notes and 140 oh thanks so they got their they got their 250. that's what they
2:06:50
offered to buy back and they got up to 250. and 150 minutes of 2027 consideration for for aggregate acceleration because
2:06:56
there's 127 million so that yeah they have that
2:07:02
since the aggregate principle amount of issued second cities did not exceed the maximum second layer exchange crp did not issue third oh they didn't
2:07:08
even issue the third lead notes there we go so they were only going to issue them if the people who were interested
2:07:14
to do the bond exchange were greater than the 250 but they didn't have to okay i've never i'm i'm not an expert on
2:07:19
these types of things i'm still like trying to learn this is kind of why i'm reading through it i hope it's i hope it's educational for you but uh
2:07:26
there's been a lot of bond exchanges this year like way more than i've ever come across of course i'm tracking more companies too but i'm trying to learn
2:07:33
you know plus i'm getting it gets my attention i mean you're you're it's it's a huge value add to be able to
2:07:38
wipe out this debt at these discount prices of course it's you're in a tough position to even get to do this but uh
2:07:44
if you come out the other side it could be a huge boon okay so following the settlement
2:07:51
645 aggregate principal amount of old notes remain outstanding a second one have none will not be
2:07:56
registered okay so they just registered those notes okay all right
2:08:05
let me just check out those fundamentals
2:08:12
where's that total debt figure oh sorry i just want to see that was that total uh debt last quarter or this quarter oh sorry
2:08:19
i'm in the wrong damn thing let me move this damn spreadsheet over it's confusing me time 908 okay
2:08:29
total debt 1.1 billion
2:08:40
i just want to see the balance sheet what's that balance sheet look like i should have already had that open already you know what i mean
2:08:47
what's this is that the balance sheet did it oh it might be
2:08:53
no that's the announcement
2:08:58
all right so they did that bond exchange
2:09:05
all right so now we can just we can just let's just jump into the range please let's see what they say reduce costs
2:09:11
okay implemented yep executed reducing total senior note see that they reduce
2:09:16
total senior note debt by 127 million go the bondholders had to take a haircut if they wanted to
2:09:22
go this path um currently stimulating five drilled okay
2:09:28
reduced total capital budget yep expect to be essentially cash cashflow neutral for the remainder of the year okay it's not bad for the second quarter
2:09:37
they reported net income there's probably some idiosyncrasies there second quarter was the most challenging to protect the balance sheet drastically
2:09:44
reduced capex we also implement a series of cost reduction minimized cash second quarter operating
2:09:50
results all right what's the outlook uh playing targets i don't care about any of this may 22nd we go damn we could have just
2:09:56
scrolled down [ __ ] they got a highlight they got a summary of the exchange results right
2:10:01
here 250 members about but by holders of 254 million of the companies 900 millions you know
2:10:07
sitting let's exchange their notes for 127 million see that it's nice as a result 900 million in
2:10:16
senior unsecured knowledge was reduced by 250 million to 264 the dead exchange resulted in an overall
2:10:21
reduction to the company's total principal amount there you go and lowered future interest expense wow
2:10:27
okay here we go the comparison between recent periods of total principal debt okay
2:10:33
oh wait that what's going on with that figure what's how can we sell 1.1 billion what's this
2:10:42
it's bizarre okay but now we're at one times revenue which is still
2:10:48
where the hell are we getting i don't feel like looking into it this is accurate forget the spreadsheet
2:10:54
forget the spreadsheet how dare you is it june 30th centennial 7.2 million in cash 370 oh and 370 million of borrowings
2:11:03
under it's oh they got 370 million under it's revolver oh there you go that's how you get to a billion that
2:11:09
total debt is including the revolver as it should i mean it's a little bit different of a debt but it's still debt
2:11:14
got to pay that off during the court of the company borrowed 135 million
2:11:20
oh jeez they're in a tough position
2:11:30
i think i'm gonna add i think we'd add they would add i only wish i only wish
2:11:38
uh you're not going to see anyone buying this thing though because they own they don't know they own the whole thing oh let's just check this presentation real
2:11:43
real quick oh it's the same thing oh can i just oh
2:11:49
it's not that long of a presentation good macro environment blah blah blah executed dead exchange embedded credit
2:11:54
facility to replace total leveraging to replace total leverage covenants through year-end 2021 with first lien
2:12:00
all right so they took care of some covenant issues that's always thinking you got to be care of careful i do my best but i can't
2:12:05
it's hard for me to pinpoint those covenant figures covenant metrics each quarter um but the
2:12:11
covenant you trip a covenant and then that will kind of force you into bankruptcy i've seen it so many times so i'm i'm like hyper aware i do my best to be
2:12:18
hyper aware of what the covenants are but they're tough to calculate because you get a that's a lot goes into it
2:12:24
um all right there's what am i good that's not that i'm gonna i mean i know some people like look at this stuff and they're experts on it not
2:12:30
me i'm a generalist and uh oh there's a nice graphic oh looking at
2:12:37
the damn earnings releases still educational i do it for the education but you can look at this stuff here there's a nice graphic if you wanted to learn more i
2:12:42
may have pulled this back up later i don't know if forum energy had one like this but this is nice um
2:12:49
you see the interest expense went down like you see a successful bond exchange they got it across i think gamestops was a resounding
2:12:56
success i think because they got rid of some covenants and they had just enough to to get the deal
2:13:02
done but look at this 127 million deduction but still in a tough spot
2:13:13
no note maturities until 2025 i like that highlight and so you see some they talk about some figures here first lien
2:13:19
debt uh the gist is they're in a tough spot um but
2:13:28
we get the risks yeah so i can have to be funded with cash flow ah this is a mess
2:13:40
but this is a mess so i'm gonna add oh i do what what i like i like i'd like
2:13:49
no one's talking about it let me just see this balance sheet no one buys the um that's just the value
2:13:54
the asset the value of the assets right no one are you trade seven percent of tens of book that might be the lowest i've seen
2:13:59
of a company that remains publicly traded it's like what the hell um
2:14:07
wait where's that revolver is this c deaf where's the revolver long-term debt 1.1 billion oh did they
2:14:14
include it as 1.1 maybe they included in long-term debt uh whatever uh but boy if the value of
2:14:20
the if the value of the assets is um again even if it's just a fraction even
2:14:26
if it's just a fraction of of um what's book value scroll over
2:14:33
tangible book 2.7 you know what i mean and what's the market cap right now 211
2:14:41
wow that's not nothing i mean forum is way smaller than that oh i kind of like that
2:14:47
oh excuse me i wanted to do um
2:14:53
64 million you know what i mean that's um so this is interesting to me it's 200 200
2:14:58
million for a market cap i'm going to add to this you know what i mean if you're in really
2:15:03
damn yahoo finance we got places to be we can't be wasting time 212.
2:15:12
you know what this price reminds me of is as a g poor was that the one traded in the gutter yup look at that i nailed it
2:15:21
it had it had bounced back strongly oh it's really coming back
2:15:29
oh i didn't like that they didn't they didn't break to new highs
2:15:34
i mean it's this is high risk play make no mistake about it but um the chart looks interesting right here
2:15:40
at support you don't want to see it break down 200 million market cap that's legit
2:15:46
you know what i mean like a company like this a penny stock right you see it below a dollar but um
2:15:54
all this debt to revenue to and um
2:16:00
permian basin and then what's one final thing i want to check no one wrote wrote anything on
2:16:06
we already looked that up right no one wrote anything i don't know these
2:16:11
people an elephant analog he writes on everything so there's nothing here of
2:16:17
value unless someone commented on something who commented on it let's just check this anyone anyone why are others reporting a
2:16:24
loss read it from the website if you remove the 127 you get negative eps oh see they
2:16:30
need and then again if you do the bond exchange that's that's a gain on your
2:16:36
uh and your earnings you know what i mean that's why it's legit all right so no comments
2:16:46
and then finally um just remind me how much they um
2:16:53
how much do they actually own this is going to tell us
2:17:00
yeah there you go they own 30 hey prescott we saw prescott didn't we
2:17:06
just see prescott with something how about the management okay oh they're
2:17:13
uh the look at la pierre or however you pronounce it they're they're they must be um
2:17:19
they're on the board they control the damn company they got 30 and with prescott they got 40 percent
2:17:25
but that's them that's that's not individuals well yeah prescott group capital management
2:17:35
when we just cross paths with them
2:17:48
is that them there was a there's a couple prescotts but i swear
2:17:54
that was them with sivio is that where we came across maybe it was them c dev oh look at a huge decline look
2:18:01
um in the proxy they owned 23 million as of when
2:18:16
march 13th march 13th oh that's an odd time you know what i mean that was right right as everything was
2:18:23
going on so if they sold in q2 they sold after march 13th they could have sold in late march
2:18:29
do you blame them you don't so what i mean so they had 23 and then they sold 15 million so
2:18:36
kind of discount them they didn't see as strong of a compelling case here
2:18:42
kind of a bummer even though i don't know him but again you don't knock him too much there's so many opportunities out there
2:18:47
it's it's tough but it would have been super bullish if they held on or if they added you know what i mean
2:18:58
bummer so it's this is all on riverstone
2:19:03
and they were buying they were buying what after the bond exchange as soon as
2:19:09
the bond exchange interesting
2:19:16
the bond exchange was announced april 22nd are they really buying more 91
2:19:31
i thought i just had a all right
2:19:38
yeah they went from 83 to 90. okay i think i'll add i think i'll add
2:19:54
job i'm going to specify
2:20:05
uh but very leveraged no maturities till
2:20:12
25 recent bond exchange net of the gain
2:20:20
increased margins at 50 that'll be more helpful for me riverstone controls company
2:20:27
buying in may usual energy risks delaware
2:20:41
um how big is it in the portfolio it's in the portfolio right
2:20:50
small point three percent that's it it's tough i mean if these are risk on so if
2:20:58
if everything sells off including these energy bits these are these ones are going to get whacked make no mistake plus i get to figure out their listing
2:21:03
they got six months to figure out their listing issue they probably do a reverse split which is fine who cares
2:21:09
bait x2 these are all going to get whacked you got to be careful getting into these but it's a good everything the setup looks okay
2:21:16
and remember look how big this was i mean the chart looks like [ __ ] as we talked about this looks terrible but it traded um is this app book value
2:21:25
came public at 10 traded at 20.
2:21:30
no traded two times about two times book value and now it trades at uh seven percent of
2:21:36
it you don't need much to go right but if things go wrong you're screwed you're screwed they but they already got the bond exchange
2:21:42
they got a little bit of wiggle room 30 percent they care they're they're trying
2:21:52
the setup looks decent the setup looks decent but this looks this kind of looks bad though don't it but this is why econo but if
2:21:58
the month look the month looks like [ __ ] how about the weekly it's coming up doesn't look great but
2:22:04
just barely hanging in there and we're talking about oil if oil breaks this is going to get this one it's right there it's remember a lot of
2:22:10
a lot of other oil stock looks super bullish but uh what was it it was just at two oh we could get a quick bump
2:22:15
boy that got up to two all right this is an ad you know what i mean sometimes these are someone controls the company no one's
2:22:20
really buying it because they're like yeah so-and-so controls it but this still got bit up look at that this was mid this was mid-bond exchange
2:22:28
april 22nd they announced it april 22nd and stock price started taking off
2:22:37
and then it kind of tracked all value all value was up this wasn't specific to them but people bought it people bought it
2:22:43
and it's helpful that 200 million dollar market count if this was like a 30 million market cap i'd be less confident
2:22:51
i liked uh this is an ad it has 10 bagger potential too
2:22:59
it traded at book value i traded that book value
2:23:04
15 months ago 15 months i know it's energy and a lot happened over the past 15 months this year in particular right not lost
2:23:10
to me it's not my point my point is just traded a book value 15 years ago 15 months ago
2:23:15
um [ __ ]
2:23:20
but there's still some potential ten beggars in the energy space some of them have already turned into
2:23:26
ten bags some of them are five baggers ten baggers already i can think of like five off the top of
2:23:32
my head you got c dev you get sand ridge um you got forum energy fet
2:23:40
um those are the three off the top i had bay tanks i don't know if that's got 10 bag or potential i don't think so
2:23:47
antero from the lowe's 10 bagger potential same for rrc over this that's multi-year though
2:23:53
these ones could happen relatively quickly if suddenly energy popped up to 60 bucks you know what i mean which is always a possibility
2:24:00
and those natural gas ones those more multi-year but in tarot from the lows that'll be that could be a ten bagger
2:24:05
any other ones then with this you gotta watch energy closely though right i mean you're gonna
2:24:11
see more ten beggars in a cyclical industry let me get this out of the way
2:24:18
let's do this i was trying to think aloud here
2:24:24
flowtech i could be but remember they're changing the whole business that's why
2:24:31
it could be a ten bagger i mean if they're if what they're doing and the insiders are bullish that could be it could be a 50 bag or a hundred bag you know what i
2:24:37
mean if they've got the the right idea as to what's possible um with the with the energy data that they're going down that path but i just
2:24:43
don't have much insight into that i'm not an expert on that stuff antero rc pbf now sandra yes
2:24:49
pump pump from the lows could be a um a 10 bagger the lowest was a dollar fifty
2:24:55
um but you need energy to really bounce back but it's not a 10 bagger from here p10 not really
2:25:00
water could be forum yes ovv already it's already a 10 dagger or it's gonna
2:25:06
be but not anymore not from here ngs no not from here oh did i buy more ngs how big was that
2:25:14
oh [ __ ] you can't go back i wanted to go back one what's right there 0.66 i bought a little bit didn't i
2:25:21
i kind of want a little bit more you know
2:25:31
i'm taking my time i think i added but i'm like ah i'll take my time i got plenty of time to get into i've got plenty of time to add some more to it
2:25:39
gte oh gte was one too look at that [ __ ] okay
2:25:45
look at this okay so the similar chat right similar chart um
2:25:51
so oh [ __ ] it came all the way back down it wasn't it's come down okay insiders doing
2:25:57
anything there oh they're starting to sell but small small a small percentage so they were
2:26:04
buying too gmt they're about a ton kind of got walloped so this is a
2:26:10
similar chart here do we add to both of these i'm not really looking for more energy exposure
2:26:16
but you know what i mean these um that's a july article a lot of comments on
2:26:22
there the value portfolio oh it's a lot more chatter about this one i've it's in the i mean i've owned it for a while
2:26:30
but there's a reason for this sharply weak so these are same so this is the same trade it's the same trade you might just diversify across them both except we
2:26:37
already like at the bond exchange like we looked into ah looking digi
2:26:47
i'm going to say um it seems like this could still be bigger i hope you can see that okay um
2:26:55
look it's the same i think i suspect it's the same trade except i don't know if there's a major owner who owns 20 30 of that [ __ ] you know
2:27:02
let's just check it was gmt capital they were buying up a [ __ ] done
2:27:09
does anyone own a chunk large chunk now they still own 22 as of june 30th it's their 17th
2:27:17
largest position no one else
2:27:22
it's the same trade isn't it but i just have to look into
2:27:30
like the one thing um c dev's already got going for it i don't feel like looking into another one right now look i'll look later
2:27:36
but this is i think it's a similar train it could be helpful to diversify and then let me just check the bonds real
2:27:42
quick at least someone's got a good chunk damn i bought in like 15 20 cents that sucks
2:27:49
it's kind of pulled back it was like a four bagger ah [ __ ] so bonds in the similar
2:27:54
place look at this 20 20 25 so in a similar pot pond wise huh wow very similar trade 2025 2027 the bonds are traded in the
2:28:01
40s very similar damn
2:28:08
i mean i was up on a lot of positions on june 8th there i don't i don't think i took any i don't
2:28:14
think i took any profits maybe i did but not my oh it's uh
2:28:20
i legit bought it 20 cents i remember was it this one this one too now fvt i bought it 20
2:28:27
cents this one i don't remember it was that a buck yeah i think i might
2:28:33
add to this too i might i can't do it side on c and i at least need to look
2:28:49
so much energy exposure this is just good for us to remember announces completion of his credit
2:28:55
facility redetermination that was june 1st first quarter announce the second
2:29:00
quarter results what i got to say about all i really care about is the uh
2:29:07
of the credit facility in covenant waiver until october 2021 saw they got a waiver on their covenants for 12 months that's all just a waiver
2:29:15
successfully completed semi-annual redetermination the borrowing base limit was redetermined
2:29:21
was granted relief under the
2:29:30
okay i don't know
2:29:36
i just want some comments on the um financial situation hedges in place yeah
2:29:43
blah blah blah position to thrive in 2021 if you say so we'll see
2:29:49
operations update i don't care a message should we reduced our tony
2:29:55
capex yeah because you had to you run a lot of money no i'll look or come on sorry i know i'm
2:30:04
scrolling a bunch i know all right let's keep moving let's keep moving it's almost 9 30. what are we going to look something else
2:30:10
just make that note gte interesting though
2:30:18
all right now we're going to look at die bold
2:30:26
miller value pull that up we're going to look at dbd oh yeah not just also quick uh caught on game stop paul keeps
2:30:33
this article today i thought this is pretty good i like the the focus on
2:30:42
oh that was the author oh i said did i see him responding um i don't know if you like this i like
2:30:47
this though because i i mean i own options and no one's really talking about it much right now they're super expensive
2:30:53
um oh i i think i mentioned that they were super expensive um but i did pick up a little bit more i
2:30:58
found there's some they're still expensive but i'm kind of treating a little bit like they got a little bit more pricier than they were a
2:31:04
month ago of course right but i bought more i bought more stock bought everything more in july but you can buy on the way
2:31:10
up too in the thesis i just thought i'd buy a little bit a little bit more but anyway so they he talked about this
2:31:16
i thought he kind of had his finger on the pulse a lot of it he was um he got he understood the story
2:31:22
his introduction stuff brief history i thought it was good bullish case um a short squeeze case study talks
2:31:28
about volkswagen i don't know about that huh i mean that's what that's the one everyone wants to talk about
2:31:35
what people were talking about too and it's been discussed before is that so in my i had included an adjusted float
2:31:40
figure i include an adjusted float figure in my latest gamestop video right where i talk about uh included you exclude heston permit
2:31:48
and scion and must and um who's the other one
2:31:54
the other guy the billionaire guy who bought in um i said exclude them from the flow but i think this guy did he do it where he
2:32:00
went through and he excluded the funds from the float and um
2:32:08
i kind of get i guess i get why because the floats the funds aren't necessarily going to be selling out just because the price rises in theory depending on why
2:32:15
they hold them they might be buying more because of that right so they're in a weird position because they're the ones
2:32:20
who are lending loaning out their shares for people to short so i'll be honest this is above my pace
2:32:26
above my pay grade the can this be systematically unwound with so many people talking about this
2:32:32
squeeze you would think that it almost can happen right like every everyone sees the hundred percent
2:32:38
um in this one i mean this volkswagen was such a unique thing they were only like six percent you know there was a
2:32:44
it's a good little history less than six percent of the voting stock remained and um it was only but that's the thing was
2:32:50
only 12 percent of shares were shorted but there was a reason like they had like there was a a merger announcement
2:32:56
you know what i mean like this there could be people selling all the way up because if unless they don't no longer think the
2:33:01
terminal value is zero that's why it's so important to get that narrative right if management changes the narrative um
2:33:08
that people actually think it could be a growth stock which could i still think it could happen with the consoles everyone starts talking about it but
2:33:14
management needs to step up their game they really do it's august it's about to be september and they um
2:33:20
um but i don't know as people talk about it more it may not even matter how compelling their story is because people
2:33:26
might just start buying it but anyway does he do this or did someone commented on it talking about he
2:33:31
so he did he did good work here like pulling up all this stuff and i quickly glanced at it and it looked in the ballpark of reality
2:33:37
and not many people do this i do this i was doing this and um
2:33:42
not to this degree he really went through i kind of just ballparked it although i was curious oh so that's what he did where did he
2:33:49
get these um where'd he get those 20 20 figures
2:33:58
where did he get those he doesn't say where he got those where do you see the june 12th and june 16th
2:34:07
did i miss that
2:34:12
oh he got him from here smart yep
2:34:19
nice he really he went through each one props i didn't do that i used last year's proxy as a ballpark
2:34:25
figure as to how much they roughly had he actually went through pulled up each form four and within the form four
2:34:31
they will show you how many shares you these were these weren't purchases usually form four you're looking at
2:34:36
for share purchases uh is this not opening come on um but uh
2:34:43
when shares are issued to you as well you file the form for right i think that's how that works those aren't opening on me but that's
2:34:49
what he did he went through all those form force it's taking a while huh
2:34:55
what if i did this
2:35:05
there you go there you go
2:35:12
he went through there we can get the form for us this way a little back doorway a mono security is beneficially on following the reported transactions nice
2:35:18
job he went through and actually pulled up each form four and penciled it in but it's the reason i didn't do this is because it's so small the number of
2:35:24
shares that these oh i didn't even look at his thing but what is it what is the total it doesn't even total a million
2:35:29
he i knew sherman owned uh quite a bit oh he has two million
2:35:36
he was two million okay that's more than i thought but everyone else look how small it is
2:35:43
but he okay these ones are 20 19 but these 20 20 ones are all so small relative to 65 million shares outstanding it wasn't as big i'm like
2:35:49
it's not worth the effort it's like it doesn't make a difference uh we we need to know but where's 5
2:35:55
million shares or 10 million shares we're all those um so james bell he has he has half a
2:36:01
mill but sherman see sherman's got 2 million does he have 2 million that's legit
2:36:06
i knew it was at least a million in my mind i didn't know that it was over two though
2:36:13
i trust this guy's work though if he's going through each one four so that two million is legit actually it's almost as much as barry you know
2:36:18
but it's important that he's aligned but um so nine million shares
2:36:24
oh that's kind of oh he's included he's done permit well he's done permanent has more than uh
2:36:31
that's this he's oh he's kind of messed up a little bit here because he they own um he's only got
2:36:38
he's only got uh see i consider hester and permanent insiders at this point but he's in because they've there's
2:36:44
joint letters together you know what i mean in total they own over 4 million shares and so i would say they own even more than nine million so he's only got um
2:36:51
wolf because um and paul evans because they're directors and so he only pulled those up but
2:36:57
they own much more than that so there's actually closer to 12 13 million shares and so he included
2:37:04
institutions right and then he goes through i include foster and most asset and scion and permit
2:37:10
and then he does his adjusted float calculation and i don't see i don't know with these
2:37:17
with these funds first of all you you need to set an onslaught of people who want gamestop
2:37:23
shares you know what i mean so that's the thing with this volkswagen they had to close their shorts and they were running out of shares to buy they're running out of shares to buy
2:37:29
with gamestop um unless there's a merger announcement or something highly unlikely it's like there's a good chance there'll
2:37:35
be plenty of shares to buy back because on the way up if people still believe the terminal value is zero might people be selling their shares all
2:37:41
the way up you might not be able to get that high on the short squeeze because uh you need substantial demand
2:37:46
and not many people willing to sell but it's interesting because the funds maybe they're not going to be selling
2:37:53
but if it's their if they're the ones who have to i don't know i don't know about i don't know but
2:37:58
we're i'm really curious to see how it unfolds but i thought this was a good article because it's just a new take on the situation
2:38:04
and i'm not sure um where the hell did you get those figures though didn't i see was he forecasting like 10
2:38:09
million in revenues or something
2:38:16
i don't know definitely was talking about there but um and then these charts i don't i mean i
2:38:23
understand what they're saying but uh it's just just some charts kind of illustrating this point i mean i think i own some of the ones he
2:38:29
was talking about some of the calls he assigned some probability so this is good stuff though to actually go through and assign probability probabilities
2:38:35
that's good i don't do this as much i don't do this
2:38:41
i don't go to this level of detail i just need to just hopefully you can tell that by the stream right i'm just trying to get the gist on [ __ ]
2:38:47
it could game stock must be way higher and if so what's the probability of that that's it but to go through each line on them i
2:38:53
guess you do it intuitively but um i like when someone goes through a good good work to
2:38:58
do that and to actually put a percentage on it not many people willing to do that even i haven't outright done it but look at that and
2:39:06
then it gives the adjusted value [ __ ] i mean i hope this guy he he does a good conclusion too because
2:39:11
he says there's a non-zero chance assumes 15.50 although that's the thing too 15 50 as of september 15th
2:39:19
i'll take i mean that's a true short squeeze what like september
2:39:26
i don't know why he chose that date and then he's talking about the spike i mean his volatility increases you've already seen it though that's why some of these
2:39:31
uh gamestop options are expensive because volatility has increased a bit and has always been vixx is still over
2:39:37
20. um so it's across stocks but in particular gamestop but um
2:39:43
yeah i don't know i don't know the likelihood of this someone else asked me about the short squeeze again too it was a good a good back and forth and um i don't
2:39:52
know it's impo it's it's it's educational to like think through these to definitely to think to like read this article and
2:39:57
just think through what do you think the probabilities are and that type of stuff and that's what i was doing as i read it and again i have
2:40:02
i own some of the calls he's talking about here and i go [ __ ] i hope he's right but um still just i don't know doesn't seem
2:40:08
like so obvious it seems like so obvious that it doesn't seem like it could happen but i really don't know if maybe it can be system oh there's a ton of people
2:40:14
posting on this as well but anyway check that out good article
2:40:20
and um oh did i announce this too it sounds
2:40:26
like there's going to be a um a an updated uh switch did i forget when i uh
2:40:32
came across that it was yesterday so we probably didn't talk about it there's going to be a upgraded switch that's going to be released oh [ __ ] yeah that's sick
2:40:38
there's always something to talk about with gamestop these days right something new but there's going to be a new switch
2:40:44
it's a it's rumor right but it's on bloomberg it seems like it could be legit i think i uh and um and then it's like
2:40:49
spring 2022 or spring not spring 2021 was it no i think i saved the article but um
2:41:03
absolutely whatever i want to call it
2:41:10
oh [ __ ] it's 20 21 oh [ __ ] on my mind i was thinking 2022.
2:41:18
oh we'll get news on this soon then oh how much more downside protection so
2:41:24
this is sick for a number of reasons i i almost wish this news came out before my latest video because i would have included that you know i talked up the
2:41:29
nintendos i talked up the switch and i mean they they skew a little bit more physical
2:41:34
but also it's hugely popular these days and um it's and that's great news for game stuff because it does skew phys sku uh
2:41:41
there's a lot of people who want the physical games and stuff but even still just another console even though it's
2:41:47
just an upgrade there's going to be tremendous demand for this just like this tremendous demand for the current switch console and when people are buying these
2:41:53
consoles they're coming in and um and they're they're often buying games in real time buying bundles and stuff
2:41:59
remember gamestop has that captive audience with their 60 million members and so forth and um
2:42:04
i was talking i was talking to someone today too is a good discussion talking about how with these larger consoles too and no
2:42:09
one's really talked about this i hadn't even thought about this but he brought up a good point saying how people want to
2:42:15
you can buy a console on amazon you can buy a console anywhere but um people kind of want to buy that more expensive console
2:42:20
in a physical store no this isn't a big part of the thesis right it's just kind of like i never really thought about that it's people kind of want to buy that in
2:42:26
the store and when they do that they might be poking around at bundles and stuff and discs that's a big part of the thesis anyway this is another reason for
2:42:32
people to come into a store this this console this upgraded switch [ __ ] i didn't realize it was going to be 2021
2:42:37
that's um this is big news for uh people interested in gamestop's downside
2:42:42
protection so um because it once it's confirmed if it is confirmed it's just another it's
2:42:48
another way for cash flow to come in the door gamestop held up well during the last up switch like the revenues held held stabilized oh here we go another
2:42:55
hey what's up jordan cheers mate good question hey thank you some other folks asked me questions on monday too i meant it thank you for
2:43:00
asking the questions because it results in like i'd say discussion but it's more you ask the questions but i'm responding but
2:43:06
it's good to like talk through this too especially because it's a big position but all right can gme double so i can play around with your other
2:43:12
that's a good one i like that september 9th hoping for a 1.2 billion in revenue would cause a huge move
2:43:17
so yeah september 9th because they announced today that's when they're going to announce um their updated earnings so do you
2:43:24
think i know so i've been wondering about this um so first of all i i'm on the same page with you though jordan i'm hoping
2:43:29
this [ __ ] can double and triple right because i want to invest more across my other picks too you know what i mean and i
2:43:34
think this is one of the nearest term catalysts of a lot of the stocks that i'm dealing in and so it's a big reason this position
2:43:41
is getting bigger and bigger over time too is because i think it's going to unfold sooner and sooner i hope i'm not wrong about that but indeed i'm hoping it like
2:43:48
it jumps quick here and then i'll use that capital to buy these other positions so i'm in the same boat as you i hope so but um
2:43:54
as far as q what is this q it's q2 i don't know so um first of all is it
2:44:00
going to be a good quarter like i was talking was i talking about this earlier in the stream how if after every
2:44:05
damn earnings release over the past year the thing um the thing uh sells off right after like
2:44:12
six earnings certain earnings releases on a real boom sell-off boom sell-off and then many times it bounce right back up right
2:44:18
and um and this one it was up but then sold off but that's because everyone's selling off but uh so i'm starting to think are we finally
2:44:24
starting to get to the point where it's finally going to start beating on the upside sentiment wise it really is going to come down to sentiment
2:44:29
i do think this is probably the last of the kind of relatively shitty quarters coming up that just passed um but there's a
2:44:36
question of is it already priced in i do think it's already priced in but it really this sentiment's been tricky because i guess even i found it hard to believe that
2:44:42
we're still trading below five in august that that seems stunning to me but um i don't know we're gonna be so close to the console refresh
2:44:49
and uh maybe this gets bit up in the next two weeks you already see it rising i mean it's already up 25 percent in august a lot of stuff is
2:44:57
but still what if it goes up another 25 or something then we're at six or seven that increases the chances of a pullback
2:45:03
but i don't know so a couple things i think they could beat 1.2 billion in revenue yeah i don't
2:45:09
you think so um would they have one billion they had one
2:45:15
billion in uh in in q1 right one bill one billion in q1 and then you think it picked up even more
2:45:21
i don't know i don't have a super strong forecast for this quarter it's in my mind it's more is it or is it
2:45:26
finally going to like surprise people to the upside or surprise people downside uh the revenues figure is going to be
2:45:31
somewhat important right but it's more this is there going to be a narrative that's discussed that's going to change is going to be a story that's shared by
2:45:38
management that's going to change the negative sentiment that um gamestop can't get out of and there's a couple things that can happen the revenue
2:45:44
itself how they performed right did they outperform on revenues did they outperform earnings right that's standard stuff
2:45:50
but also sale lease back the closing of the sale lease back how much cash did they generate from that 50 million 100
2:45:55
million i lean more toward the lower side but and what did they do with that cash is it possible they they bought back
2:46:01
some debt or even shares i don't think it's possible but imagine i said this the other day imagine if on
2:46:07
that we've seen a couple huge volume days i again i doubt it was them but if it was and they announced on this conference
2:46:13
call forget everything else so they announced there's only 40 million shares left and we're two months away from the new
2:46:18
consoles how can you i mean the stock price needs to be repriced significantly higher it just does because then the upside's even
2:46:24
higher i think especially if as long as that balance sheet is still looking strong but um yeah there's a lot of a lot of
2:46:30
different things that they could release and then a potential vendor partnership now we're real close by the time that rolls around
2:46:36
will the pre-order stuff be announced and stuff and the price points and the dates like it's possible they announced some
2:46:42
sort of in-store partnership some sort of maybe people get an early poke an early look at the consoles in
2:46:47
their store um but we need more on that now on the story like how they're going to
2:46:52
transform themselves and it's been eerily quiet over the past couple months they've been focused on the bond exchange and then
2:46:57
like super quiet for better or worse i lean toward i think it's good i think it's good maybe they're kind of
2:47:03
um planning on releasing all their news at once in if in september
2:47:09
maybe i was thinking maybe they wanted to get all the negative news behind them because i thought this quarter could be
2:47:14
rough i'm not so sure and then it's only good news moving forward to be honest i don't this is mere speculation right we're just having fun just trying to
2:47:20
guess it's all guesswork but i lean toward we're so damn close to what i consider the capitalists that um
2:47:28
like someone i was asked today if it does sell off following their earnings what i sell it's highly unlikely that i
2:47:34
personally would i reserve the right to change my opinion right all of us do but i don't know what i could possibly hear in this earnings release that would make
2:47:40
me think there doesn't remain substantial downside protection at the current price point of four five five bucks right now what
2:47:47
could they announce i don't even if the quarter is a [ __ ] quarter these consoles are still coming out i
2:47:52
mean then this this switch news which i wasn't really expecting especially for 2021
2:47:57
what could they possibly announce that could be so negative and so bearish the only thing i could think of and i think this is
2:48:02
highly unlikely is if they were like oh we're not going to have a large share of uh the consoles to sell and the games
2:48:08
and stuff because the sony and nintendo aren't going to issue them to it highly that's highly highly unlikely gamestop sort of
2:48:14
got a huge a giant share of the market especially brick and mortar and uh they they're partners they're kind of
2:48:19
partners in this so plus they took care of their credit issues and stuff and um so i think that's high that's the only
2:48:25
thing that i'd be like oh are people not going to be shopping there as much as i thought but other than that i don't care if the if there was 800 million on revenues
2:48:31
like it's r it doesn't change my thesis um but i'm with you let's hope
2:48:37
let's hope the q3 gets this stuff started in the right direction and that it's just up well down downhill
2:48:45
i don't know uphill downhill that has jumped up from there but uh i i i you have to think that this thesis has to unfold
2:48:51
within i mean i've long been thinking by gen by within um by like january february april
2:48:58
of next year like because that's when sentiment will be its highest but the whole they need to have this story crafted within 18 months at this
2:49:04
point what is its august 2020 like like i would change my mind come
2:49:10
12 months from now then i'd be like ah [ __ ] i guess i was just wrong about this because if it doesn't happen and while the consoles are coming out like this is
2:49:15
a huge opportunity to to unload all this positive news and this bullish stuff so
2:49:21
i don't know why you know what i mean like if we're just so close it's going to be september well we'll see i don't have precise forecasts for this quarter
2:49:27
i i um i'm not sure how much of a difference it will make but i i i thank you for sharing yours 1.2
2:49:33
billion i'm sure i'm going to keep that in mind when they actually announce it be like oh yeah jordan was right
2:49:39
or when other people make the forecast too um but um yeah game just gaming generally
2:49:45
has been so much more in favor this i still don't know if it's a net benefit but this coveted stuff um
2:49:51
like they're having year over year like huge gains where this this was supposed to be a really tough period for and it's still a tough period i'm not saying it's
2:49:57
not you know what i mean but like that we're even talking about um that the that might only be they were only
2:50:02
down like four percent in may or something year over year i'm like holy [ __ ] they're holding up pretty well this is supposed to be a really quiet period
2:50:07
real tough period for gamestop we're not many people shopping there but maybe maybe they'll do okay i don't know yeah
2:50:13
i guess we'll see but um yeah man it's just shaping up and the stock price just keeps on going up
2:50:18
set five bucks i don't know what else just watch it now i'll be curious i'm going to bet that it gets
2:50:25
100 speculation there i i bet that it gets bit up leading into the earnings release um because of how cheap it is
2:50:34
that's it because of how cheap it is in just the mere passage of two weeks um gets us closer to the console refresh
2:50:40
and then the earnings release that people they'll start they'll start um getting involved i think it's already started
2:50:46
happening i think that's what this is because there's been no news of course right or not much news we should say um and uh
2:50:53
but yeah we'll see you know what i mean charlotte looks good too imagine if this thing breaks above 650
2:50:58
and [ __ ] i don't even know but um yeah we'll see about that shorts go ahead don't i still don't know about the show it's not totally sold in short
2:51:04
squeeze but i see it i see what everyone's talking about and we'll see oh yeah can we do some artwork on here
2:51:09
because really the whole thesis is based on these lines on this chart right
2:51:14
it's like right there right it's like always stopping out right in those fives but um
2:51:20
i don't know we'll see okay what else was i talking about oh i
2:51:26
talked about this article yeah i don't know if um yeah i mean if there's a short screen so
2:51:32
i mean again i own some of the options right and uh boy some of these could be maybe some of the one in theory some of the i
2:51:37
wasn't intending some of them to be like um i don't i hate to even say this because i don't this isn't how i typically roll
2:51:43
but some of them could be 100 [ __ ] can you imagine i um not necessarily at the prices they're at
2:51:49
today but uh i got lucky on some of the um cost basis on some that could be but
2:51:54
that's the thing that's it seems too good to be true but how often do you see 100 short interest
2:52:01
i don't know anyway that was i this is worth checking out there's articles worth checking on i appreciate
2:52:06
the new takes that was good um what the hell else were we doing we're going to check out bill miller now
2:52:12
it's 9 so you get me going on gamestop forget about it the whole stream's over once when i get talking about cave stop [ __ ]
2:52:20
um but anyway so that oh yeah that switch
2:52:25
i've heard some rope so the nintendo switch yeah i've always thought nintendo would be a good partner for um um for gamestop a vendor partner but you
2:52:33
know it could be like xbox could be any one of them could be i don't even know what that vendor partnership would look like by the way
2:52:39
but i sure as [ __ ] hope we get news on it soon um but
2:52:45
yeah this is going to be another cash ban 2021 that's sick how much downside protection how much
2:52:51
times hyper texture can you take can you get um
2:52:58
again the consoles have lower margins right there they're slimmer margins but uh people will be buying the games and the used games are
2:53:04
or it's a huge market well i don't have numbers that's the thing i wish i had figures to support that but it appears as though you look at some of what those
2:53:09
used games are selling at gamestop and they're um that they're at huge margins at huge
2:53:16
margins so an upgrade will be good would be good ah damn that's good news
2:53:22
but that's the thing there's so much downside protection it's almost like it's so everything's marginal you know what i mean the sale lease back or
2:53:27
people talking about selling their their international operations or the uh the european operations or the australia
2:53:32
operations and i just think if they nets another 50 million or another 100 million and at this point all that stuff's marginal because it has
2:53:39
plenty of downside protection this is why i'm able to make it such a big position in the portfolio right because um in my mind the downside is
2:53:46
just limit i may be wrong about that right i might be wrong but in my analysis i at a 330 million market cap based on
2:53:53
what i think free cash flows could be i just think uh and all the cash they have on the books as of the last quarter anyway
2:53:59
and um that uh yeah there's just it's just tremendous upside potential so
2:54:04
but an extra 50 million an extra 100 million doesn't make that much of a difference for me because i i feel like it's all covered
2:54:11
but um but i like it don't get me wrong it's that's hugely helpful because i care most about the downside but at this
2:54:17
point now we're getting close it's like all right we need to change that upside viewpoint that we need people to change their viewpoint from
2:54:22
the terminal value of this company is zero ever pretty much everyone believes that even even bulls believe that um
2:54:29
that the terminal value is zero but you just need people to just think if they just think you know what terminal value isn't zero
2:54:35
that if they do have this new business model that's the thing even uh we speculate on what it could be it's kind of fun to think about it does seem
2:54:41
like it's possible that's i don't understand the people sending a zero percent but if they can just change the narrative so they they oh okay maybe they could grow alongside
2:54:48
gaming maybe it's a smaller business maybe they're much smaller much fewer stores but if people actually come in
2:54:53
and whatever the hell that is experiential products and all that but if people start thinking that and they
2:54:58
think oh [ __ ] this might be a growth company it's game over for shorts then it's game over like everything nothing else will
2:55:03
matter because then people might be falling over themselves to buy the shares that's the type of thing i'm talking about when it comes to our short squeeze
2:55:08
you need people falling over themselves like suddenly they really really really want the stock or they need the stock
2:55:14
and as of right now even though it's a huge short interest it's possible it's possible that for the mechanics of the market
2:55:20
that it could just happen because of that but really you need you need a story you
2:55:25
need a story and i think it a growth story of some sort but if that happens it's game over
2:55:30
they they'll know they're like holy [ __ ] we were wrong about this if the terminal value isn't zero it could even thrive over the long term
2:55:36
um and that's where you could have huge upside potential but that i'm looking out multi years right looking out five years
2:55:42
or something again it would be probably be a smaller company but it's at least conceivable it ain't zero that's
2:55:47
i don't understand the bear's case it's oh it's zero it's not possible i think that's crazy even at 10 or 20 percent chance it's
2:55:54
it's um it'd be a huge huge benefit to gamestop so we'll see
2:55:59
but i certainly hope that we get some some of that storytelling stuff in uh in q3 i don't think it's likely they
2:56:04
bought back shares but [ __ ] that would be great if they did i feel like they have adequate liquidity to do so but i don't think it's likely um that
2:56:11
could catch people by surprise again even catch me by surprise because i don't think it's likely but um i'm just trying there's like a a
2:56:17
confluence of things a confluence of business events that they could um that they could share and announce that
2:56:22
could catch everyone by surprise like oh they dumped it all at the same time you hope that's the case but it's always that's always the
2:56:29
it's it's not likely that's the case um but um but the bond exchange behind them
2:56:35
it's like what else could be some people talk about them going bankrupt too because of the technical defaults and stuff like that like that
2:56:40
stuff's behind them it's like only this rough corner but then all that i think it's all upside sentiment-wise newswise i think it's all
2:56:46
beats but we'll see i don't know i don't
2:56:52
i need to i should have maybe wednesdays or maybe wednesdays will be game stuff you know it's wednesdays are gamestop
2:56:57
talk until the thesis unfolds correctly or incorrectly you know what i mean hopefully correctly then we'll get together drinking a beer chilling having
2:57:03
a good time you know what i mean that'd be fun looking at the other stocks and all right where are we going to deploy that gamestop
2:57:10
hopefully we can dream right ah [ __ ] we didn't get the dvd ah damn all right well dbd we gotta
2:57:16
check that out did i make a note at least
2:57:21
ah [ __ ] i didn't
2:57:28
that's where we're going to check out because that was the one that bill miller was involved in and looking did i at least but can we pull up the fundamentals i'd be saying oh we got
2:57:34
three minutes ah is it even worth it that's the question is it even worth it we got some energy
2:57:40
picks this one this one they generate freak they generate cash flow here i don't want to say free cash flow but
2:57:46
look at this they had free cash flow generally like a buck and free cash law it's not that cheap back in the day but super leveraged look at negative
2:57:52
tangible book but real revenues four billion you know what i mean for it was huge
2:57:57
huge huge company and um relative to what i'm usually doing that's not that huge gamestop is bigger
2:58:04
than this company but huge relative to some of the other companies we're looking at it's like five times bigger
2:58:09
right six times bigger than the other companies we're just looking at but uh we need to dig into the store to speak in a story like that what i'll do for
2:58:15
some of these companies and you just we just did it with c dev you pull up just the press releases you don't need to go back 10 years for
2:58:21
something you need to look i prefer to look at long term fundamentals but if you're just trying to get the story
2:58:26
again when i talk about gamestop story that's a little bit different they need to change the story about how they're going gonna transform its
2:58:32
legacy operations into a new uh growth type experiential blah blah blah talk about story here i just mean what the hell is going on with this
2:58:38
company just pull up the damn press releases over the past 12 months 18 months usually and then watch the
2:58:44
insider buying what the insiders are doing and what the funds are doing were there any funds buying over the past couple quarters
2:58:49
and then like and when you'll see in the press releases were there bond exchanges that were happening um where um like you know what i mean
2:58:57
those like the business events just get a feel for like what the hell's going and what the price has been doing this whole time
2:59:02
and you can kind of you get the story it takes you could do the i think you could do the whole thing in an hour i think we just did c dev pretty
2:59:09
damn quick you could probably do it in 15 minutes if we were being super quick about it we could probably do it in 50 minutes but
2:59:14
you want to give yourself a little bit of wiggle room maybe 20 25 minutes which we don't have time for now you can i don't
2:59:20
think you can do it in two minutes though i don't think you can do it in two minutes i know i keep on saying two minutes like like like youtube is like you need to
2:59:26
stop it i know you could you could stream whatever the hell you want right really that's that would be my preference
2:59:32
i do this the fixed time just to keep it simple for people say at least know that i'm here but um
2:59:38
really that you do research as you all know you do research when you feel like you're i don't always feel like doing research and i don't even feel like
2:59:43
looking into companies you'll see me say that i don't feel like doing that right now i need an if there seems to be an impetus or something like ah the stock's
2:59:49
breaking out the insiders are buying or the market's selling off and that gets me going then during those times i'll work a ton i'll work a ton these days we're
2:59:56
kind of just following up on stuff and so like what we've been doing these streams over the past month is not what we would
3:00:01
always be doing over the next couple um um months or years or anything like that it's always changing what we're doing so
3:00:07
anyway as far as when it comes to getting the story on the company you can't do it in uh well now we're down to one minute
3:00:12
but um right off the bat i see it trades at uh a solid discount to revenues but not
3:00:19
that cheap you know what i mean it was much cheaper when i was trading like a buck or two or whatever it was
3:00:25
you got revenues of 52 bucks to share but then a negative tangible book and the free cash flows weren't as large as i thought simpler
3:00:30
free cash flow of a two bucks a buck a buck but they had a strong market share you know what i mean like they dominated those atms
3:00:36
those um i think it's atms right can we just check oh it's 10. youtube's coming after me ah
3:00:45
right divold you see the die bold on the things right
3:00:51
yeah that's it all right they like had a strong foothold like they're they're the they're the
3:00:57
dominant player so that always catches my attention i like dominant players right everyone likes dominant players but when um when you're trading in the
3:01:03
gutter you're a deep value stock and you're a dominant player that's sick um but so we'll have to look more to
3:01:09
this look into it get the story it doesn't look super cheap but the
3:01:16
chart look good right
3:01:21
yeah this looks this looks good right but a longer term it's like it's got some it's got some work to do
3:01:27
i don't know it's let's get some wrists right all this real oh let's just check the bombs real quick we could we should probably just start
3:01:32
with that look at that 100 it's traded at 93.
3:01:39
2024 bonds yeah you see the ccc all right not ranked that highly right but um
3:01:44
not rated that highly it only got down to 60. that's because it i could generates real cash how much is this 400
3:01:51
million sick all right that's not that bad
3:01:57
bonds at 93. did we say there was not much insider
3:02:02
buying right oh but bill miller did we make a note i feel like we did make a note on that
3:02:12
bill miller bitcoin lover just bought in in july is that what we said all right i do need let me just check
3:02:18
that
3:02:27
july 2020 he he at least he reported in july he may have been adding to this position
3:02:32
for years you know what i mean but he just breached a certain threshold to have to file in july you know what i mean so it could
3:02:38
have just been a marginal purchase people i think people sometimes missed that point but now it's his now that's it i think
3:02:44
it's his trust i looked into it but it says it's the second largest position he's only got four though
3:02:50
but uh and that's different from miller value but we know that they own it too um but um
3:02:57
how much is he on 10 percent
3:03:10
also on in the miller value partnership fund
3:03:19
and how much are they on there four percent they're going 15 that's legit
3:03:28
huh and you know what else you want to check when you the store talked about the story right management changes you know what i mean you want to see
3:03:34
his management turn over people missing that with gamestop when people say that you know they didn't do good analysis because how could you not know games
3:03:41
have changed up their management and that the new management can't be blamed for the past shitty decisions of the like that's just
3:03:46
that's that's analysis 101 like that's ridiculous so but i'm looking at these companies too and i see a company like oh you're really messed up like i did
3:03:52
with gamestop like you really messed up like you need to how are you going to fix this do i really expect the same management team
3:03:57
to fix their [ __ ] and get it right usually not i'm like i might take a position but i it's an extra risk i have
3:04:02
to deal with so like with something like dvd maybe they had a maybe they [ __ ] cleaned house uh last year or something the past
3:04:09
two years and they they got some new players and they know what they're doing and bill miller has talked him up just like barry is now talking up these
3:04:15
uh the new gamestop management team because they've proved themselves to a degree to me too to a degree um and so maybe that happened that's the
3:04:22
thing too i'm like all right so the change in the management team they got a new board blah blah blah it's some of those soft things that i look at
3:04:28
that that can make a difference like without seeing bill miller take this 14 position i would have been less
3:04:34
interested in digging deeper but you know what a good thing too i talk about how messy this is i talk about how i keep on going to that
3:04:40
one this is a messy this is a messy fundament look at all this red bleed into depth as i said oh no
3:04:46
this is quarterly ah this is quarterly i did it i'll fix this anyway we can at least see 2020. it's a
3:04:52
lot of red at least in the recent recent this is rolling 12 month data just ignore this stuff what i'm just getting at is that you see negative
3:04:58
tangible book value revenues have like stabilized it's like a messy company to analyze and although
3:05:05
this is difficult for me and this would be difficult for me to value i'll do my best but it's going to be i i'll probably lean on some ebitda
3:05:11
figures which i don't love using on ebitda but i need something i'll lean on fairly stable revenues i'll
3:05:17
lean on i can't lean on earnings they don't have any look at this this is quarterly i know it's all messy
3:05:23
forget the data just for today but the rolling 12 month you got like since 2016 rolling 12-month losses every
3:05:29
single how do you value that company and even operating cash flow negative negative negative um and then finally it turned positive so
3:05:36
that's a good sign a little bit of an inflection point so it's like what do you lean on to come up with a value i'd probably lean on some operating cash flow stuff simple
3:05:42
free cash flow it's a little bit more reasonable than these evita figures but i got something i'd probably apply to multiple to ebitda
3:05:49
and um that's what i mean it doesn't look super cheap even based on ebitda it's staying at like four times ebitda
3:05:54
or something it's not crazy it's crazy cheap given the leverage um and but anyway what i was getting at
3:06:01
is that other people don't want to deal with this they don't want to deal with this stock they see this stuff they're like
3:06:06
not for me out of my circle companies then they'll move on and even i get close to that with some companies but here i think this is
3:06:12
potential opportunity even though it's going to be really tough for me to try to come up with something it's tough for other people too and they'll just move on and that kind
3:06:18
of can result in an opportunity it doesn't mean there's one here but it's something like all right this is going to be tough let's see what we
3:06:23
can find and that's where i lean more on the story that's being told by the press releases in the filings insider buying blah blah
3:06:30
blah you get that now um all right now well over now now i'm definitely um you two i'm going to be arrested 1006
3:06:37
you kidding me when they find out i went past 10 just don't tell anybody that i went this late oh i got a lot of beer we're entering chug mode i got a lot of beer left
3:06:47
anything else we're gonna go through yeah that buy list was good see today i was glad i had that buy list you know it
3:06:53
kind of reminded me of some things to actually have it in a list because this this is good for command effing but
3:06:59
if you want a list it's good all right so i'll keep that and i'll just i just got to be better about managing that buy list
3:07:07
all right cheers everybody jordan thanks for the good question and um what is today wednesday all right have a nice couple of days and
3:07:14
i'll see you on friday all right okay peace out
