They mention that they have been buying more of certain stocks, such as Antero and Sandwich, and that they have been keeping a close eye on others for potential insider buying. The speaker discusses the potential of various stocks, focusing on Fossil and comparing it to GameStop. They note that Fossil's revenues have significantly declined, but highlight the company's strong historical earnings and balance sheet. The speaker suggests that if Fossil can maintain demand for its watches in the next few years, it could be a good investment. However, they also acknowledge the risks associated with the company, including the secular decline in demand for traditional watches. The speaker concludes by stating that while Fossil's current price is higher than they would prefer, the company's strong cash flow and low debt make it an interesting prospect for deep value investors. The speaker discusses the potential for GameStop's financial performance in the coming years, particularly focusing on free cash flow forecasts for 2021 and 2022. They argue that despite the company's struggles, it's possible for GameStop to generate between $200 million and $500 million in free cash flow in 2021, given the upcoming release of new gaming consoles and the company's cost management efforts. The speaker also suggests that if GameStop can successfully transform itself into a go-to spot for gaming experiences, it could stabilize its revenues and potentially grow alongside the thriving gaming industry. However, they acknowledge that these are optimistic scenarios and that many people consider the chance of such a transformation to be zero. The discussion revolves around the anticipation and potential impact of new gaming consoles, specifically the Xbox One and PS4. The speaker suggests that these consoles could generate more excitement than their predecessors due to improved graphics and a strong lineup of games. They also discuss the financial situation of GameStop, noting that the company has been making strategic moves such as cost-cutting and share buybacks. The speaker speculates that GameStop could generate significant free cash flow in the coming years, particularly with the release of the new consoles. They also mention the company's successful refinancing of its debt and potential proceeds from the sale of assets. However, they express uncertainty about GameStop's future capital allocation decisions and the lack of material announcements on its transformation plans. The speaker discusses the potential of GameStop's stock, emphasizing the importance of understanding the company's fundamentals and technical analysis. They highlight the potential for significant free cash flow if the company can reduce its shares to 40 million. The speaker also discusses the possibility of GameStop successfully transforming its business model, which could lead to significant upside. They note that many people focus on business analysis, overlooking the importance of security analysis to determine the stock's worth. The speaker also mentions the importance of capital allocation and business decisions in assessing a company's value. They express confidence in their analysis, viewing any potential mistakes as opportunities for learning. The speaker also discusses the impact of accounting changes on the perception of GameStop's leverage ratios, arguing that these changes have not fundamentally altered the company's position. They conclude by emphasizing the importance of combining fundamental analysis with technical analysis to develop a strong conviction in a stock. The speaker discusses the potential for a short squeeze in GameStop's stock, emphasizing the need for a shift in market sentiment towards the company's long-term growth prospects. They argue that while GameStop's stock is currently undervalued, a significant increase in price could occur if the company announces positive news such as earnings beats, share repurchases, vendor partnerships, or major in-store gaming experiences. This, combined with the upcoming console refreshes, could lead to a change in market perception of GameStop's terminal value, potentially triggering a short squeeze. However, the speaker also acknowledges the uncertainty of this outcome and the need for convincing announcements from the company. The speaker discusses the potential for GameStop's stock to rise, emphasizing the importance of a narrative shift for the company. They suggest that GameStop's future could involve a transformation into a growth story, which could take up to two years. The speaker also highlights the significance of insider buying as a metric for assessing a company's potential, using examples such as OVV and CNR. They caution, however, that insider buying should be considered in context, as it can sometimes be misleading. The speaker also mentions Fossil, noting significant insider buying and suggesting it could be a stock to watch. The speaker discusses their investment strategies and experiences, focusing on the importance of understanding the type of play and how to size it. They mention their preference for metrics such as sales to price and EV/EBITDA, and the significance of insider buying. They also share a story about a missed opportunity with Apple options during a volatile market period in March 2020, highlighting the tension between their value investing approach and the temptation to speculate. The speaker also mentions their interest in energy stocks, specifically Gulfport, and their regret over not capitalizing on a short squeeze. They conclude by emphasizing the importance of learning from investment experiences, even when they result in missed opportunities. The discussion revolves around analyzing various stocks and their performance, with a particular focus on the energy industry. The speaker discusses the performance of stocks such as RFP, Vera Bradley, Movado, and FTK, among others. They highlight the importance of insider buying as a positive signal for a stock, using FTK as an example where a director's significant purchase indicates confidence in the company. The speaker also emphasizes the importance of a strong balance sheet, using FTK's balance sheet as an example. They suggest that a strong balance sheet can counteract negative factors such as a drop in revenue or negative operating cash flow. The speaker also mentions the need for a weekly review of stock performance.
