2:45

all right let's do it some some news right after right off the bat here i'm just about done with that new gamestop

2:50

video that's taking me mad long it's uh i like film some of that footage today hopefully

2:56

hopefully i might be able to finish it i gotta edit it and edit and but hopefully it's uh up tomorrow maybe we'll see sometimes

3:02

i'll once i get right to the finish line i find some stuff i need to change so anyway keep an eye out for that and then i can start working on some other stuff

3:08

but okay mark it uh what what happened you say wednesday what happened yesterday i'm not even sure what happened yes i

3:14

forget i have a little idea as to what happened today i checked in a little bit i saw things were down a little bit but

3:20

nothing too much look at that i mean if you don't unless you see color as you always say i don't see any color brazil down a little bit

3:25

whatever i just said trout look like yeah not great not great but ted look at the rsi hidden

3:33

south below 50. all right something to keep an eye on could be what's what's what's russia doing

3:38

out of curiosity you might i haven't been checking out the uh emerging market

3:44

china looks okay wow geez took out those highs already

3:49

too well um let me just check russia that'd be one i'm curious about

3:56

brazil russia the bric countries you know okay so it didn't get to its new highs yet but it's that still looks good

4:01

maybe something unique about um was there some news out in brazil they got a lot of political stuff that sometimes

4:07

hits the wire and you will sell off on that thailand not much there's not nothing to

4:13

dig into here this is this is a mostly um nothing day from what it looks like

4:18

so far also can you see me okay i had to all right that looks okay okay what do we got here uh commodities

4:24

okay so i did see that some of the uh commodities sold off a little bit today except for natural gas

4:29

that was holding up good but now let me just check oh oil oils to nothing we don't even need to check that damn chart

4:35

wait gold's still above 2000 is that not up to date

4:42

like it might be a little bit out of date is it out of date one day maybe okay yeah it's right down a little bit but

4:48

still noise right it doesn't matter i'd like to i so i remember if you mention i i checked out these i pulled

4:54

i made a couple of uh trades which i'll talk about in just a sec but i had thought about adding to silver and

5:00

i didn't do it yesterday and then today i saw stuff was pulling back a little bit would silver do today too i saw everything pulling back but you know

5:06

it's it's just not that big of a move it's just does this is right there uh

5:13

so i'll keep my eye on it i'd like something more but i didn't even dabble i'm comfortable with the current even at five percent six percent of whatever it

5:19

is i remember i bought some iag a little bit so right now i'm just waiting either keep going up or come

5:25

back down maybe i'll add but i'm not doing anything right here just watching just watching from the sidelines um

5:32

and then copper still holding up 290 did it ever break three by the way oh ho ho ho it did is this a day is this

5:38

a day out what's this august 19th oh it's above three today oh this looks like it's a little bit out of date then huh what do you think

5:44

i don't know that's fine well copper breaking above three okay it's kind of the is it the bell

5:50

weather that people talk about i don't know not as much because we're more of a services-based economy but um you would think it's those those

5:57

base metals you know what i mean do they kind of lead the industrial the industrial world wow that's a big move up oh what was the

6:03

news on copper today let's check

6:10

that's a big move huh oh so copper was up today too i

6:15

mentioned uh natural gas geez i missed copper tops three dollars per pound see that was in the news today

6:21

yeah it sticks out to me too um more than two years city lifts price

6:26

outlook as lme stockpiles stockpile okay so inventory stockpiles

6:32

um all right price will drive the stockpiles and vice

6:38

versa and blah blah blah oh kirklands was up again today i just see that right here hey where's rfp crushing and how well we'll get

6:44

we'll get to individual stocks here tier high is rio tinto delayed we're starting a smelter more actively traded and not much okay

6:52

still a big move cool that's not bearish really i think okay

6:58

uh and then shipping was up too or the company my ersk was up but other than that not much happen

7:03

we see gold miners down today too what are the i mean this is going to roughly mimic yeah it looks the same as

7:09

the gold chart right there's nothing else here maybe a bit more volatile i guess but uh all right and then silver miners

7:18

i forget that this is an etf you know sil they can't it can't be that big of a market cap out of curiosity what is the

7:24

market cap for this

7:29

655 million yeah that's i mean that's not that big for etfs right just curious erroneous erroneous on all

7:37

accounts okay all right not much else i mean i don't

7:43

know what happened yesterday but uh that's fine i figure if something will come across it eventually you know

7:48

what i mean it's okay that i miss a day i mean i this happens this is how i function really for the sake of the stream maybe it

7:53

changes but me personally i just i'm not checking stuff every day how can you and then stuff will move and then i'll check it i'll say oh this so

7:59

this is what it's been doing the past couple weeks i just wait for it to to move uh i guess that's the benefit of

8:04

being a a relatively longer-term value investor you know what i mean okay okay in the wrist column we see gold

8:11

tech tech was up seven percent today or copper because copper was up big and alcoa is going to be up too for similar

8:17

reasons um yeah it looks great huh

8:22

tech great great still only a double though remember what i i didn't add too much because i didn't think there was much upside but still a

8:28

really below ten dollars is a great time to buy that company really is a relatively i mean uh relatively low

8:36

risk play in my opinion i know it's commodities and stuff but still alcoa that's just crushing it

8:41

that's i mean that's one of the topics oh it's right here look at this it's um what position is that now it's

8:48

top 20. now it's top 20. i should have i showed a little bit heavier but the thing was i thought i was going to be able to

8:53

i still thought i was gonna might be able to average into alcoa it was one of those big companies i thought it might bumble along but it bounced back

8:59

so strong i have i probably trimmed it a little bit but not much all right and then freeport see that was

9:05

the one we just checked fcx asked savannah's pulling back that's going to happen with uh gold and silver

9:11

pulling back what's in palladium would palladium do today just 22.40 roughly

9:17

ryder and that much oh what's bitcoin doing yeah is that up to date 12 000 why do i

9:24

think that this isn't up to date maybe i need a um maybe i need a refresh

9:32

i'll do that in just a sec so i broke below 12 huh but noise noise there's nothing going on there just keep an eye on it still looks

9:39

decidedly bullish but we'll see what happens in gbtc now this is a riot huh yeah all right

9:47

down day whatever see what happens oh what's tesla see these are all like grouped uh i categorize them all the same uh

9:54

i group them all the same on my mind tesla holding up there oh yeah tesla was an all-time high you say oh cheers cheers elon and cheers tesla

10:03

holy hell huh that is something i still think it's coming for that big round number 2000

10:08

for no other reason except it's a big round number that's it you know what i mean and uh and prevailing sentiment and all that stuff right but i just mean

10:13

price point i think it's coming for two no position no position just uh just based on charts and uh

10:21

incentive it oh this is a riot what's the marking couch this is my uh this is my fav this might

10:28

be my favorite um stock that i have no position and there's so many people tracking it

10:35

right 350 billion officially 350 billion what a hoot oh this is a riot

10:43

wow that's something to behold some damn look at that thing huh

10:52

really bullish really bullish how high can it go i don't even know it doesn't feel like it's over yet that's all those that's those are my

10:58

only takes i feel like it's coming for two and it doesn't feel like it's over yet um i i think i said this before

11:04

for a lot of these more trendier stocks and i mean even like bitcoin like these trendier plays like

11:10

if if they were gonna if we were gonna rotate out of them and in sentiment was going to go putting that people going to be done with them they had their chance

11:16

in march and april this year that was it that was a chance for everyone to be like you know what i'm done with this stuff

11:21

get me into more maybe traditionally more like uh traditional like value

11:27

investors value investments and stuff um away from the growth here type things that uh traded high multiples

11:33

like this that was a great opportunity for people to be like i'm done with it and it didn't happen and you could tell pretty quickly tesla

11:39

well tesla's a special case right because tesla just retested the loads like it re-tested a little how that's that was bullish tesla pulling

11:45

back it only hit in and only hit and hitting it's it's it's past resistance now support was bullish

11:51

and you knew it right out of the gate you knew it as early as april and uh i mean i don't know about bitcoin

11:56

uh let me just now i'm just curious and when it didn't happen i i like i was i got i got probably

12:02

personally got really bullish on all these things it's been a critique of mine right i feel like i've said that in so many

12:08

videos and streams now it's been a critique of my own that i i i wish i had gone even heavier um but see look at this was this uh the

12:16

same thing for bitcoin this is bitcoin right yeah four thousand they all like held up and these are just

12:21

a couple of seconds but if you pick any of those trendier i mean um like is it what are you

12:26

grouping video with this too they like hold that they held up so damn well what do you what do you do with that

12:31

this so this other well i could just check the risk intergalactic i mean there's i guess

12:37

this is this oh i do have a video oh netflix would not flip stone now i'm just curious you know what i mean like this this is how i try to learn myself

12:43

as i blow what the hell happened there yeah never even pulled they barely pulled back i didn't realize how

12:49

actually i didn't realize how little they didn't even they barely pulled back see what i mean bullish

12:54

ah anyway the time will cut the time will come where that this rotation out of these types of stuff will happen it's inevitable this uh i don't wanna i

13:02

mean i don't wanna say it always happens but this it's so it so tends to happen you can kind of bet on these types of rotations

13:08

it's just human nature it would truly be a shock if it didn't happen eventually i'm not saying it happens tomorrow or anything like that

13:13

but this is just usually how investors function and some people are saying this is this has gone on longer than um than they

13:18

usually do which may be the case but it um so it could always change absolutely could always change i

13:24

i try to avoid absolutes for that reason um and i try to be flexible for that reason that this is why i mean

13:30

back in the day when i was a younger value investor i'd like kind of scoff at these things right and maybe i'm affected because they've

13:36

been going up for so long it's totally possible right not lost on me but i don't know i can kind of get the case and i think

13:41

i don't know anyway no positions any of these stocks this is just for fun uh all right so 7 13 okay we did a good

13:48

time that was the dashboard not much going on today maybe some pullbacks just something some stuff to keep an eye on all right let's

13:54

check the portfolio what would you say rfp was there news today damn did i make a note to add to

14:00

rfp because i didn't do it damn where did when did i do it let me

14:05

see no i definitely did it was it the first week

14:11

no really i have it in the uh that surprises me i

14:17

could have sworn that i did oh okay well maybe that's the thing maybe i should have explicitly written that huh

14:23

okay and it was this no this this has been helpful for me by the way because um it's kind of a no it's kind

14:29

of a a lot of work for me if you've seen the other videos i i don't like scrolling and pulling up but uh like having to add something to

14:35

the buy list in the spreadsheets a lot of work just tossing up this notes and pretty quick and then i can the next day i just pull this up and look at it we only take a couple of notes it's been

14:41

sick and i don't always act on everything here but it's just a quick quick reminder for me so i didn't even add rfp

14:46

okay in my mind i was always going to add because uh i was going to add about 25 to the position i was kind of waiting for it to

14:52

pick up and i i think i did mention this on the stream it pulled back below three one day nah this is the

14:58

i think it was last week this day and i saw i i saw it in the morning and it came right back up and i thought

15:04

ah all right no big deal because this was looking like a good support i know it's silly but i mean

15:09

it's such a big position because fundamentals right hopefully that's clear but i watched these charts for adding and trimming and stuff and i

15:14

started go below three and i thought that was a good opportunity and i thought that that day i mentioned it to a friend

15:20

and uh came right back up and i thought all right i get a little bit of time and then boom boom boom boom see what i mean so these things can happen quick

15:26

and it's i still view it as like a even from here a two bag or three beggar even potentially a four bagger so it's kind

15:32

of silly that even a 25 move i'd be oh it's even bigger than that though it's a 50 move

15:40

oh let me fix the opacity there i see that hold on let me see if i can fix the opacity there my bad i just had to

15:46

i just had to um fix this because when i was recording the the videos for game stuff i had to mess

15:51

up my green screen i had the thing flip things around okay sorry about that um fifty percent move

15:57

damn see it i mean it happened so quick it was like it was a affiliate was like was this last

16:03

wednesday yeah it was wednesday it was a week ago damn

16:09

anyway maybe it pulls back i'm not pulling the trigger now now it's getting right back to this oh this was historic a little bit of a little bit of support

16:14

here too we're always testing this stuff right i wouldn't say it's high conviction but i'm always testing it's just tests and i saw where it was

16:22

oh not that strong it's only a couple weeks not that big but it still caught my attention i should this is why standing by orders

16:29

can help right now i can't do it there's just too many damn positions but in theory that's what i'd be doing i'd be like if i add like hey let's buy this here

16:35

what i would do is i just add a standing by or just put it out there whatever my limit is and it gets triggered when it gets triggered you can't be thinking

16:40

about this stuff right now i have to it's the nature of my current situation but um that's what you'd really do we do

16:46

i could do it i could even do it during the stream like toss it in the order and just have it sit there and then it gets executed no no thinking that's the way to do it

16:52

that's why it's good with teams and stuff like that it's just tougher as an individual investor especially with so many positions so

16:58

at this point i'm going to wait for a pullback and it's fine because it's the second biggest position of the portfolio

17:03

now check it number two what do you want me to do like i'm upset it's up 50 in a week and i'm upset right like

17:09

it's so silly this is the life of a value investor right and it's almost three percent of the portfolio so it's

17:14

that's sick right it's awesome it's just that day i was like i gotta add so oh well that's cool um i still think

17:21

it could keep running what surprised me today was there any damn news that was what surprised me

17:28

did i miss anything i didn't see anything and it's a really quiet company because

17:35

i was lumber up again oh i should get in the habit of checking that out because that one's been berserk um sorry let me scroll back over what

17:43

the hell's lumbered is it still making like all-time highs it's been cranking i probably have it in the uh

17:50

i probably have it in this wrist column don't i i should i do i do i do i think i mentioned i i do wow look at

17:57

that huh i know i have exposure to lumber if you want to say it by way of um

18:02

real like residential real estate type plays and i mean and rfp i mean it's um tangentially related but wow this is

18:09

crushing it huh super overbought super bullish and this is the thing you know you expect

18:15

quick pullbacks and stuff sometimes you don't get it that much i know holy hell huh damn

18:21

okay what was the new out of career was there a news there is that is that why because rf was all i

18:28

mean this this kind of you see how big lumber was up i guess it's safe to say wow

18:34

damn oh they all set a whole bunch of the the

18:42

lumber canadian producers all-time highs crushing it

18:47

an upgrade okay so it got an upgrade today wow 22 percent on an upgrade that's something huh on rfp too

18:55

which i mean kind of quiet cut kind of a kind of a quiet stock there's not always news and it's because uh some of the bigger

19:00

investors have like control of the company and they're like kind of quiet they were too quiet for me because i've said this

19:06

a couple of times but like i wanted to keep adding to the position i eat like even when it was still in the ones and the twos like i wanted to go

19:11

super heavy i said to a friend i literally this day it was a it was a phone call on april 1st it was trading

19:17

at a buck and i said this is going to be one of those 10 baggers coming out of one of my ten beggars because i tracked it all the way down i'm super

19:23

super high conviction play and there were plenty of other 10 beggars too right like camping world was the 10 beggar for me

19:29

i didn't think that that was going to be a 10 bagger whereas rfp i'm like this is this is 10 bagger potential right here

19:34

that day april 1st and um and i wanted to keep buying more on the way up and i did i def i did buy some

19:40

but i was just so quiet they weren't saying anything they weren't doing anything the insiders weren't taking action the value investors weren't

19:46

saying anything they had announced back in like january or february they were going to do a very small like like a buyback program but he didn't

19:52

know if they were buying back in the open market it was like really kind of weird and i just wanted a little bit more but still you could see my conviction

19:58

right i mean as it's as clear to me as it's clear to you right that it's the second largest position in the portfolio and i haven't

20:05

even been trimming stuff but um i think it could keep running i um i just it's leveraged but um a lot of it

20:12

is like pension liabilities too and um yeah just to when when when lumber's

20:17

crushing it and uh assets that it has is is in favor it's

20:24

it's really a demand it generates a ton of free cash flow like a ton of free cash flow uh let's check out the historical fund i don't even need to

20:30

pull it up because i looked at it so many times but um keep it rocking just to make sure it was just an upgrade though that's kind of

20:36

weird what did they upgrade they upgraded to or anything just to outperform nope

20:42

and i don't even hurt who is oh i mean it's rbc no who was it that upgraded them yeah our

20:48

rbc capital and i i don't know oh it's just a big move i guess lumber it's just lumber driving it cool

20:55

form four is it just issuing just issuing stuff maybe look at

21:01

that there's even even a small sail there from the svp all right

21:06

okay let's keep going here ngd down that's because gold's down i'm still keeping there so i didn't i didn't

21:12

add anything i also didn't trim anything just just watching it for now on cnr just kind of bumbling around taking

21:18

his time after that big jump last week it's hitting right at the route resistance which a lot of things are with the market and stuff

21:24

um so okay so here's this is something i did see happen so look at first of all look at antero okay

21:31

now it's the seventh posit seventh largest position the portfolio so this was one this is one action i did do so huge

21:38

sell-off yesterday in fact i didn't even fully read um that whole press release yes but they

21:45

were doing a um offering of a convertible senior notes which i which generally i don't love uh

21:50

it just depends on the circumstances and stuff and so it sold off like was it 15 20 something something impressive and i had

21:57

mentioned i definitely mentioned in one of these i'm not gonna go hunt it down that um

22:02

to add to ar and i didn't i was waiting i had added maybe a little bit i added

22:08

maybe last week but not much like you it still wasn't in a top 20 position or anything like that or even top 30 i

22:13

don't think because i still have that rrc exposure so i was kind of waiting just because i was waiting for a

22:18

pullback really and um and then i got it yesterday so uh the new this was the news it was a

22:26

convertible wait 18th yeah a private placement to to

22:31

it's a private placement too not floating it to the public um for four percent convertible senior

22:37

notes to 2026 so a little bit a little bit of a time frame there um a little bit of a time cushion i'd

22:43

rather and then um i didn't look through the full details of the convertibles wait there

22:50

you go the initial rate conversion price of approximately 434 okay approximately 20 over the last reported

22:56

sale price wait is this the second press release oh

23:02

it is it is the second part oh you know what i saw this first press release i was going to say i didn't think it was priced i didn't think it was price that

23:08

first time i started also they use it because they're using the price after the sell-off yeah the 20

23:14

of the last reported sale price which was after you made the initial announcement the hell kind of a weird thing

23:20

um comedy stock exceeds all right so i mean it's just a convertible note so i

23:26

wish they had do they have any um commentary on it that's what i wanted to see

23:31

repurchase their notes okay so there's some nuances to the notes and stuff but at the end of the day they issued

23:36

convertible notes you know what i mean that's what the market sees that's what i see too you hope it's opportunistic but you're

23:41

like why now i mean natural gas has been cranking and uh natural gas stocks have been

23:47

cranking and maybe they are they my question is are they a little bit

23:52

bearish on natural gas prices did they put them box themselves into a corner um [Music]

23:59

i'm not as dialed in with antero as i as i am with some other company so i'm not totally sure

24:04

but the way i see it is what i've said about natural gas many times is that this could be a multi-year trend

24:10

multi-year turnaround for natural gas stocks and ontario management seems like they're aligned with shareholders

24:15

they've even been buying back shares i double checked that they bought back like what 20 percent of shares or so you know now i got to pull

24:20

it up um plus they have a pretty solid

24:26

oh i got it out nice

24:32

they have a don't they have a pretty solid stake in ontario

24:41

i want to say like is it none paul ratey he owns he owns six percent is that it okay

24:49

let me just check this is what i do for like confirmation when i want to see like managing i'll pull up the proxy and then

24:55

you gotta do um beneficial ownership try to get right to it boom sailing stone eight point four

25:04

percent paul ready five point six yeah and paul they own ten percent together which isn't a ton it isn't a ton but um

25:12

it's something and that guy buy him cell phones five percent um and then i think let me just check

25:17

that share of purchases too it's gamestop it keeps up all over the

25:23

place now i've had it up because i was just checking it for the uh the video

25:29

oh it's taking a while close out of some stuff

25:36

a little bit slow today huh do i have oh i have so i might i think because i have final cut open damn

25:42

i probably should have closed that um yeah i checked the share approach about they went from 310 to 268. what's

25:48

that decline 13 not a ton but it was telling it was

25:54

kind of surprising too because they're so leveraged it's like what the hell are you doing there um it's still a billion dollar company

26:00

but anyway a big part of my thesis now and i'm not afraid to say this well two things the first is the

26:05

fundamental case for natural gas is that supply has is being curtailed and i do expect

26:11

natural gas prices to rise over the next six to 12 months too going into the winter and everything i think it could break are we already at

26:18

what's that what's the natural gas futures curve did i can i put can i pull it up here

26:30

contracts yeah you can see it so okay we're already above three for the futures contracts but i could see the

26:35

spot price getting above three and that's all super bullish and it's kind of getting priced in by way of some of these natural gas stocks anyway so i remain bullish for

26:42

fundamental reasons um and then if the economy gets back truck crank and a lot of this is the market

26:48

trying to get ahead of itself like trying to crank back and just natural gas demand could rise

26:53

and um that's the thinking but then i've also mentioned probably numerous times now i'm losing track how how uh the sector's gotten his ass

27:01

kicked for five five years um and we can see i'll just pull up rrc

27:06

it's just an example and these things i mean as this is happening supplies getting cut supplies getting supplies getting cut and then eventually

27:13

it turns around and then you get a multi-year bull market in it and you get this final capitulation which of course a lot of things

27:19

this final capitulation was for a lot of reasons right i mean co the pandemic and everything but um sometimes this is like the

27:24

catalyst to turn things around and um this is in so this is super bullish and i'm thinking like

27:29

i'm not saying this is definitely going to happen but i i feel like it could and look at we're almost getting over oh this is rrc almost overbought on the

27:36

weekly huh and um and yeah like these cyclical

27:42

types of names it's not uncommon so it could be happening right here and so i'm operating under

27:47

that assumption and but will i'm willing to say that i'm wrong that's perfectly fine but so far as i still think that's

27:52

the case just like i thought it was gold this is the thing i've seen it happen i've seen it happen like a handful of times now i think i mentioned this about

27:59

gold um back and well let me use a 20-year chart for this

28:05

but um it seemed to it seemed to bottom right

28:10

around here and then on every pullback this is what i'm getting at and we're still very early if this is a multi-user

28:16

but every pullback i was saying i'm operating on the assumption that this is the turnaround because it seemed like it

28:21

had been what was this five years one two three four something like five six years and it's like

28:26

okay and then and i'm also looking at the the prices of the individual stocks just like i'm doing with natural gas you

28:32

see these natural gas players trading at fractions of of book value now book value may

28:37

include is in question right nevertheless the point is that this when the stocks themselves are just trading at super discount prices and

28:43

you've seen capitulation the prices and so forth and for fundamental reasons it looks like things could be turning around

28:49

and then the charts start turning around then when you get these pullbacks you i kind of operate an assumption like this is just a pullback we're not taking out

28:54

the lows or anything like that and it's in in the same thing for here you don't even didn't even retest those lows here

29:00

and so it happened with gold i feel like it's happening with commodities generally too um although a whole bunch of oil names

29:06

took out some their 2016 lows i mean oil prices that's a kind of a little bit of a more special case given all that's going on

29:13

um in in with that commodity but never but that's anyway so i'm working on that option so so antero sells off right for

29:21

a very largely a business specific reason issuing convertible notes and then it raises the questions of liquidity

29:28

i mean of of um liquidity risk and solvency risk and then it's back in the headlines because

29:34

it's a legitimate risk with antero let me turn this off and then let's pop up the bonds let's just check this out i

29:41

think i feel like we just did this and they were still trading um not in the gutter but definitely not

29:46

super compelling oh this is better than i remembered did they did they did they get up did

29:54

they rise i felt i thought i thought they were more in the 60s what was i looking at maybe i was looking at a different name

30:05

it does look like they're up a bit look at this they're up right and because it's a little bit of a safer i mean they just raise some some

30:11

notes so you would expect these to hold up well it increases the chances these bondholders are going to get paid but but still discount right i mean 30

30:18

traded at a 30 discount to par but um was that the 2023s what's the 2022s what do those have been

30:24

doing out of curiosity wow yeah hold it up okay so 84.

30:32

so a discount but like my type of discount right other people won't like this i think 70 that ain't bad at all

30:37

um oh you know what we were looking at two we were trying we were checking to see how low it got back in the day

30:42

too but these bomb prices are holding up these pollen prices are really nice actually i forgot this i

30:48

feel like i was focused too much on where they traded that in march and april

30:55

okay um interesting

31:04

so anyway so when i was uh one thing i was doing is that i mean so air pulled back business specific reasons i'm like well okay let's just

31:10

keep an eye on natural gas and let's keep an eye on rrc and we need more time for this but

31:16

natural gas is crushing it this week as well now it's over 240 this is super bullish right but it's volatile it could pull

31:22

back and crash down next week or something like that but this is bullish and uh um

31:31

really bullish huh i mean uh and um we'll see what happened i never got

31:36

oversold on a weekly basis that's impressive okay but um so that's been up like if

31:42

that were tank and two and then i'm like well what's rrc doing which range it's like this still looks terrific although notice how

31:48

it got overbought quite a bit on the daily back in april but it's didn't get overbought that's bearish

31:53

hopefully it gets more aggressively overbought not a big deal but something i do look

31:59

at on the weekly it's getting oh it's okay on the week the weekly is more bullish okay

32:05

it never got overbought on the weekly back in april may but now it's kissing it right now sick okay anyway rc still looking good

32:12

swn not as good i would eqt eqt

32:19

still holding up okay wow r c oh i did a good job picking on our c did i uh what's the other one

32:26

cabot is it cabot oh i got it nice boy rrc looks the best huh i didn't

32:34

realize how much better it looked than the other ones um but still they they seem to be

32:39

holding up okay so anyway so now i'm operating under the assumption that um this whole trend is still intact for now

32:45

and that huge sell-off well somewhat legitimate might have been overdone

32:50

especially if indeed the backdrop is natural gas producers are coming back in favor and um but um

32:59

yeah and i'm not totally sold i think that i think that's the case but i'm not totally selling it like i

33:04

i sure wish there were more insiders buying remember that director bought a ton of rc right on early march and stuff and so even ar is not buying that

33:11

much they're not buying anything on the open market of stock so i don't know just something i yeah we'll

33:17

see and then i in my mind i i didn't set a stop loss although i should but in my mind i got like some stop losses

33:23

in my mind as to when i i'd start reducing but for now i'm just watching and so anyway i pulled that's a longs to

33:29

long un well a little bit of a long story anyway so i pulled the trigger on antero and um and now it's the seventh largest

33:36

position so i trimmed ovv and what i should have done was trim rrc

33:42

i almost did i had the i hid the the order up and i'm like all right let me just hold because really what i

33:48

should be doing is replacing some of our rc with ar now like now i just added a whole bunch

33:54

of natural gas exposure but i thought maybe ar got a little bit overdone on that sell-off based on that news

34:00

when this increases there i mean this improves their financial situation right but it could be diluted for shareholders

34:06

right that's the that's the risk um so i didn't i me i probably will trim

34:11

rrc just because of that but um yeah we'll see it just looks so damn bullish you know

34:17

what i mean that was the thing i pulled up stuff i'm like damn this still looks really good but really that's what you're supposed to do i don't know if i want this much natural gas exposure

34:24

um we'll see but and then i didn't i want to i think i might want to add some more sd

34:29

based on that did we talk about that on monday i think but i'm just waiting on that i'm just i'm just waiting so that would be quite

34:36

a bit of natural gas exposure but it's holding i bought some more um sd outside of the roaring kitty

34:41

portfolio um just because it looks really interesting

34:47

um so yeah i'm keeping my eye on that that's one two that kind of um

34:54

anyway but i could i could add that to the right kidney portfolio e2 uh add more to it um i feel like that

35:00

was it for the major chat like i said i mentioned i trimmed ovv just to raise some cash my cash is getting low

35:06

i should have i should have the cash allocation right right up top here you know what i mean um

35:13

but i can pull this up cash down to two point eight percent uh

35:19

and i tend to yeah i don't know that seems that seems low it's because i get that huge position in

35:24

game style i need to start going through and trim in a whole bunch of these positions that's what i gotta do i mean a lot of

35:30

them are big winners right but that's the thing some of them still look damn cheap so i don't really like to bet that oh we're

35:36

gonna everything the market's gonna give back all the gains and stuff like that could happen but i don't feel super comfortable betting

35:42

on it but i should i should just trim cash that's usually what i do is i'll trim crash just a hedge that's my hedge i'm not

35:48

usually shorting stuff but um yeah

35:54

okay and what else was going today so rfp that's a big move up still only less

36:00

than a 400 million dollar market cap huh that's something spsw

36:05

oh ufi is taking off i'm not gonna it's not gonna pull back to 10 is it

36:12

good thing good i we did add i did add to it just not huge

36:19

i think we said ten

36:25

i wish i could i wonder if i can command f and look at all

36:32

really i feel like i i feel like i've definitely taken more notes on that no all right okay okay damn that's this

36:40

that's okay i'm okay with that i i think we talked about i could park some cash in there i'll just wait for right now

36:47

because it's not like super coming that's the thing like ar and sd those could be like five baggers that's kind of why i put a little bit more in them

36:52

it's that asymmetric upside you know what i mean this would be a safe place to park cash i'm not saying it can't lose money you

36:59

can but for me this is a safer place to park cash but i'd like it a little bit cheaper huh

37:06

now i'll just watch ngs oh i held on to this company that's

37:12

good i almost i almost so they get check out this company this is it's about damn time it took forever

37:18

and they all it i saw it on march 18th i saw this oh it was march 19th it happened in the morning i didn't

37:24

i didn't pull the trigger that march 19th damn i'm no excuse me i i already had the position but i didn't add more on

37:30

that huge sell-off but i did see it go below three and i'm like oh and then i thought maybe i'd come back but i was adding all throughout here but

37:37

really strong balance sheet i want to pull this up and check this out but super small company 120 not super small 127.

37:43

but they i believe they're off they have um the equipment for producing natural gas

37:48

so people rent their stuff and it was like a super strong balance sheet too so it's maybe people are just filtering by the

37:55

phrase natural gas and they're coming across coming across this company and uh but

38:00

let me just see how let me see how um i didn't know i wasn't sure about the upside but i

38:06

i was but the balance sheet was so damn strong and i thought i i have to own it i have to keep the portfolio even

38:12

earlier this week when i was looking at potentially tr oh what happened it'll come back

38:21

um i look at this week i'm like now i better keep that natural gas equipment company in there

38:27

um oh all right i'll keep going there okay here it goes come on

38:34

yeah so these are all small like revenues wise not that much but look at all the purple and green huh is it eighteen dollars in book values

38:40

trying to five bucks and so i wanted to put even i wanted to buy actually i think the position might have been larger and then i put it into

38:46

what i thought would be have some companies i thought maybe had some more upside but like legitimate historical earnings

38:51

it's like this one looked really good um it still looks somewhat compelling maybe now it's getting people's

38:57

attention actually now it could be now it started like it people weren't talking about it much now

39:04

should i add to it oh wow i kind of forgot the historical

39:10

price on this one i see the book value

39:17

oh might be an ad

39:24

was this the weekly it's only now getting above 50 on the rsi was so slow moving

39:29

and why is that is it because i really wasn't sure i mean even the

39:34

size of the company didn't make much sense it was not that small

39:41

no that ain't it did the um do the insiders have a ton of it i

39:47

don't remember i don't you know what i mean like if is there a low flow is that part of the issue and people couldn't even um

39:54

ah

40:02

no there's not i have no idea i have no idea for such a strong balance no one just it's like no one cares about it you know

40:08

what i mean it's kind of weird to me now it's probably a buy let's make our first note of the day

40:15

um that's the thing i don't need to make notes about like a lot of stuff we just

40:21

talked about i don't need to make notes for all that because i'm starting to get back into the like internalizing stuff like i know

40:27

about rfp and i can't be writing the same damn notes over and over again i'll go crazy i know about ufi and gold and silver we

40:34

got all that this is more just some new stuff to drive my memory i'm just going to say add to ngs i could

40:40

use a little bit more of that i think look at this balance what do you how can i compete with this balance sheet

40:46

18 dollars in book value now the question is what is book value comprised of and actually here's where these these

40:52

charts can kind of come in handy it's mostly fixed assets and as i recall it's equipment you will pull it up

40:57

um mostly fixed assets hey these these graphics guys i don't use these much but they're kind of helpful and you can see

41:03

it's mostly book value but like look and look how well it was historically run right you could say oh well these are the boom years and blah

41:08

blah blah but um ah just excellent equity growth

41:13

tremendous it's one of those ones that doesn't uh like what we're looking at we've been looking at a number of

41:19

companies like that um where it's just so historically well run you can buy just you could have bought

41:24

it up based on this alone trying to get five bucks all this purple and green no liquidity uh no no debt concerns or

41:31

you'll bite on that that's it one a one minute kitty corner video done done and then you get this the

41:37

whole natural gas angle and then forget about it so that's what i mean this could even be a triple from here under the right circumstances but um

41:46

maybe i add yeah i was kind of just waiting for people to catch on it's like it was doing nothing and

41:51

everything else was flying by all the other positions so i'm like come on you could see it doing nothing and then i started to wonder um

42:01

but this is definitely a safer way to play stuff so let me just i just want to see um

42:06

well a late 10q yikes what's that about also yeah why did it run up today what the hell is this

42:15

uh all right this is their votes for the what'd they vote on

42:20

just the board nominees that's what was filed today what the hell was it up for anything in particular oh they report yesterday wow they had to

42:28

oh so they reported yesterday well that's a safe guess right a leader a provider of natural gas

42:33

compression equipment um there you go so i don't even need to pull up the 10k

42:40

demonstrated resilience and quarter that income of uh just today but uh 13 increase over the

42:46

fourth quarter fourth quarter in a increase of five point three percent one compared so it's uh if you do it was a

42:51

well adjusted but that was up year over year rental revenue an increase of 11.

42:56

revenue is up 11 year over year

43:02

companies ample liquidity 15 million in cash what how many shares outstanding

43:11

it's 13. a buck in cash low debt

43:17

forecasted cap backs of 18 million like so simple don't you love these small this that's another thing a benefit of being

43:23

a smaller investor too in the grand scheme of things talk about those big huge institutions they literally can't enter a position because

43:29

it's too small but um like 128 million can get involved with that

43:35

and um they have like really simple balance sheets and really simple businesses relative to the the behemoths the big

43:41

companies and it's just kind of nice look at this couple bullet points and you're done you get the gist of it and plus it's kind of funny seeing the small numbers

43:48

right like 15 million cash compared to everything else that's like not that much um and do they have any comment okay in

43:53

spite of continued weakness it's good to check out the sometimes you just get the quote can you weakness in

43:58

energy demand and volatile energy largely a result of the cove blah blah blah solve financial our ability to rapidly to reduce our cost structure

44:04

we have been able to address our customer's request revenues decline oh revenues did decline i was going to say that that's kind of weird there's no way

44:10

revenues are up right everyone's declining in the core we're able to post sequential gains in both gross margin and ebitda we continue to strengthen our balance

44:16

sheet and again it already has a really strong balance sheet so that's kind of interesting phrasing um delivered free cash flow during the

44:22

quarter wow and we said this about another company too if you're announcing i don't even care what it is but if you announce pause or

44:27

free cash flow during this quarter props that's impressive cash balance grew

44:33

money uh they were well commodity prices have been for the mobile business has improved slow inconsistencies new

44:38

opportunities blah blah blah all right so not there's not really much in there is anyone talking about it

44:51

see what i mean nothing nothing this guy writes articles on everything no comments on

44:56

this no comments on this one it was up how much was it up today what does it it's uh

45:01

nothing no no one talks about this which is fine that's not that's not that big of a deal but i was um yeah just looking for uh

45:09

i don't know emotional support you know what i mean but that's the thing when you see a balance sheet like that though you need it less so you don't uh

45:16

because um usually it's it's more credit risks that you're like uh my am i assessing these uh effectively but a company like this

45:22

you're like i'm just betting on um like not the demand for its products to turn around which they typically do but

45:28

with this strong of a balance sheet they probably could have sustained a few quarters uh and tangible books so i figured even if tangible book value can

45:35

let's say they have a couple of consecutive quarters of losses i'm like even if they have four quarters of losses here you're still going to have

45:40

book value of maybe like i don't know i was just guessing like 10 or 12 or something i'm like that's still

45:45

a decent margin of safety you know what i mean and and then it could always bounce back too so maybe it's an ad

45:52

i might add to it i'll be maybe get it to one percent it's just such a strong balance sheet i don't know that there's significant

45:58

upside but i can play that

46:03

look at that pre like previously it never traded look it was always about always traded at a multiple of tangible book that's what stood out to me i was

46:09

like ah what the hell this is gonna be a really safe a really

46:14

safe triple a quadruple for people who got those lows in my opinion not really safe all

46:20

relative right relative to the other positions in the rural kid grand kitty portfolio i mean um i mean i

46:28

think it's going to get back to book value yeah i think i had okay

46:36

interesting that was that why was the 10-q delayed what's that what the hell's that about

46:43

oh delay by day what's this

46:53

so it's it's not as alarming with a smaller company you don't want to see it happen but this small economy it's not that

46:59

small a company though 100 million dollars okay dude oh hey okay my apologies due to an increase of positive covid 19

47:06

cases in the midland texas area including a verified positive test among the company's professional staff the coding force is closed history no problem see what i mean

47:12

so by pulling this up now we have no reason to be concerned and um

47:21

for our second time which remains closed the office closure was dictated by positive testing okay

47:26

you know what i mean so i'm glad we pulled this out although we already saw it got filed so it's not that big a deal anyway sometimes you'll see this filed and you don't have a 10-q for

47:33

quarters of stuff usually if that's happening there's something else uh in in the announcement there but uh so it's just a couple of weeks no big

47:39

deal i mean what this shit's going on here that's what i mean that no big deal

47:49

what was this one oh there was their vote okay yeah i think would add to that and let me just see now i gotta now i

47:55

gotta i want to check this though like uh it'd be probably helpful to check out the risk factors you know what

48:01

i mean i just want to ensure pull the 10k huh how often how many times we pulled up a 10k during the

48:08

stream not much is that too big that's too big

48:15

let's go what's the business major companies oxy so they

48:22

in a customer risk here too that i forgot about 36 percent but i mean it's energy and 28

48:29

of our revenue devin so what i mean so these are legitimate businesses too you

48:34

know what i mean but a little bit of a risk a little bit but it's it's energy someone else might use their products

48:40

instead but i view them as um not bad market for compression equipment and

48:45

services depend on the condition of the oil and natural gas company including the capex budgets for domestic oil and gas companies so of course it's

48:50

going to sell off because they were they were pulling back on capex

48:56

level of activity in capex is generally dependent on the prevailing view of future gas and oil prices right no surprise

49:02

there which were influenced by numerous supply and demand factors including availability i got okay uh we

49:08

get all that part i i kind of just wanted to know the breakdown of oil versus natural gas demand oil and natural gas probably like they're kind

49:13

of talking about them in tandem is one more important than the other i mean it says natural gas compression

49:19

signal right i mean i've always thought it was natural the

49:25

compressor industry participants can achieve significant advantages to size and geographic bath breath as the number of rental

49:31

compressors in our rental fleet increases the number of sales

49:43

ah they're pretty i mean i think it's safe to say natural gas is more meaningful for this company but um

49:51

okay yeah i think this is an ad this is solid especially if you're bullish on

49:56

on natural gas and all but this is what i wanted to get to just to see sometimes they'll say well the risk of our or one of the risks i mean obviously for

50:03

energy any companies related to energy we have a good idea as to what the risks are but they may specifically say if

50:08

um right here we go decreased oil natural gas prices capital x levels yeah revenues drop oil natural gas which in turn blah blah blah

50:15

blah blah oil natural gas price foil natural gas blah blah blah blah

50:21

so it was another play just on the industry right just i diversified lower risk play really

50:29

yeah okay so they're pretty they try to keep it pretty broad

50:35

look at this a reduction in demand for oil result of operations depending on the level of activity and energy market

50:41

including oil development yeah okay

50:47

increased regulation so fracking is a risk to natural gas too by the way

50:52

um which which is kind of like a political risk in a way right just so that's

50:58

that's a fair that's a legitimate risk uh my thinking is it like oh it could

51:04

still happen but if it were gonna happen like it's kind of surprising that it didn't happen already right um but

51:11

could could still happen okay compressor rental six months right the loss of one of our current key

51:19

customers right that's a typical risk members of our management blah blah blah not much not much just usual stuff but

51:25

uh okay that's an ad it's an ad and i don't even know if i need to wait for a pullback so much because of the strength

51:31

of that balance sheet and plus i feel like i'm a little bit underexposed to it i feel like i feel

51:36

like it should already be a percent right now it's okay maybe i'll get maybe it pulls back tomorrow i trimmed ovv i mentioned

51:43

that i should try i'll trim some other stuff too it's time to do that again that i don't like that cash position so low

51:49

like xcc i'll just sell out of xcc you know what i mean i have some bigger oil plays that i've

51:57

i've been trimming those i kind of like i kind of like the names in here though okay just have to take a peek cve i can start

52:04

trimming that boy that that's kind of that uh that's turned out to be i was up quite a bit

52:09

but not much yeah oh no that is a so i had calls i had calls on this as well

52:16

because they had a tremendous amount of insider buying two canadian company look it up right this was the other half of uh

52:25

yeah canadian company what happened was um

52:31

i don't even know how to pronounce it cenavu cenopus i don't know i don't know cenavu i think it's like

52:37

french right cena vu that's so that's how i thought because it's a canadian company as if i don't know if it's based in french

52:43

canadian whatever i don't know but it's split from ankana this is number years back

52:48

and then in khan i became inventive ovv and so i've kind of tried i was in and kind of back in the day

52:54

before i knew what i was doing and uh so i tracked them both closely and then so i and then so i was buying calls on um

53:00

you know what did was this a berry stock too did he ever own that he might have owned

53:05

it last year i've i've trialed it because i've bought it since in kana but he actually might have owned this too that's that's just i don't know i forget

53:13

if that's true um anyway i picked up calls on this one an ovv and uh it was it turned out to be a good

53:19

winner those canadian companies seem to sell off worse than some of the other ones i thought went from like eight bucks down to uh to

53:26

one buck you know what i mean like that's a huge sell-off and i thought it got sold off more than the other stuff and i

53:31

i figured i have no idea but maybe it was partly just because they're canadian companies

53:36

and people just wanted u.s centric stuff maybe that's that's a probably a bull claim that could just be they were just more leveraged i'm

53:42

not really sure off the top of my head but i don't know i thought people were overlooking them for that reason so i was buying them up

53:48

and i mean i've cve was a bigger position i've been trimming all the way up

53:53

anyway i could i could start trimming that one all right i don't feel like going

53:58

through i just want to see what else anything else moving oh we see olen coming down see we're just gonna bide our time on this one

54:04

there is no rush there is no rush to get in this one let it keep coming see what i mean look at

54:09

this no rush just let it it's going to come to us it looks super bearish i know we said that on uh

54:15

wednesday i i'm pretty sure we said it on wednesday said get the position and i mean i had the

54:21

position back here but i had trimmed it because i think i put more on tse or something i think i did a good job trimming on

54:27

that one actually i might have done it really early but it never went up that much either by the way but um

54:33

this this looks bearish look at this it was then up the rsi they are this hard it never never took out the alha

54:38

never took out this high in june and then it's just down this looks bearish

54:44

and um now it's coming against a little bit of a support here which is kind of see this is a good thing we look

54:50

at so many charts right this is what i want to do part of the stream too is be looking at more charts

54:55

and stuff and have everything internalized already i could have been doing a better job of that earlier this year before covet all

55:01

happened and so that's one thing just have my finger on the pulse fundamentally but also technically and we know not many

55:07

companies have charts that look like this so this is extra bearish because um shouldn't be taken out

55:14

assuming there's anything to technical analysis shouldn't be taking all lows like this you know what i mean and um i know we looked at it that's the thing

55:20

i'm not gonna look at the fundamentals right now we just looked last week i'll give it some time and let's just see what happens with the price action and i'll pull it up again

55:26

next week i don't feel like it right now i feel good with the position of 0.6 i don't have super high conviction to think that 10 itself was super cheap

55:34

um and this looked looks it was i don't think there probably wasn't even news today was there could be a bold claim

55:48

yeah no news people just getting out of it probably expecting the dividend to get cut and all that stuff

55:55

cool come to roaring kitty come to roaring kitty and what's tsc

56:01

doing what are some of the other chemicals let's pull up the chemical names in particular so they're pulling back a little bit but still looks intact

56:07

and cc looks good you know what i mean that's bearish now you might think oh

56:14

ellen's pulling back like like i thought this with antero right i thought hey natural gas still looks good so i'll buy some antero

56:19

um but um entero was looking good right up until that announcement you know what i mean like

56:25

sorry just to do this oh well i'm this is looking bearish over a three month period compare it where they are this was

56:32

looking bullish and it had just broken out it was it was taken off on last week too and then so then this happened then it's like it still looks like it's

56:38

intact it's not like deteriorating or it looks like the rotation was taking place so that's bullish to me and that's

56:44

why i pulled the trigger but i'm not doing on overwhelm this is me trying to justify to myself it's not like i thought through all right i have so many positions i

56:50

it's not like i'm thinking through wait a second why am i not adding to olm but i'm all in dr but now as i think i'm trying to this is a manifestation of

56:57

my decisions you know what i mean um but okay

57:03

let me just close out of some stuff just because i got some stuff open on computer so i hope the stream doesn't slow down

57:08

um does olin have publicly traded let's check this out out of curiosity i'm sure these would trade oh

57:17

richly right yeah look okay i think i feel like we may have i feel like we might have looked at them

57:24

um because i mean a decent company what's

57:30

the market cap it's at least a couple million 6.5 oh only 1.5 that's not as big as i thought

57:36

it's gonna say three i mean it was i mean a couple months ago

57:41

it was uh 50 higher over 2 billion but um interesting yeah let's let's see what

57:47

happens here so i don't feel like pulling up the spreadsheet to say rk buy right now but i'll just uh and i don't even need

57:54

to add it to the i don't even need to add the note like i got the note in my head i'll remember that

58:00

all right tgb oh man this thing's really taken off i bought this at 20 cents

58:05

20 cents i got it right there i think i got it these days

58:10

ah four bagger should i bought more uh i didn't think am i not so quick look

58:17

at this what am i supposed to do no pullbacks no leveling off bam bam bam bam i was just like all right

58:24

um uh a more developmental type copper producer

58:30

damn whatever it could go this could double again by the way

58:37

i think i had uh i haven't pulled up these fundamentals in a while but i remember thinking about 50 to 250. it

58:42

kind of aligned with tangible book if i recall correctly and you had this huge sell-off could

58:47

have bought more but i feel diversified this isn't so much a missed opportunity like i mean it's in the damn portfolio

58:53

but even after this big run-up it's still only

58:59

i mean did i i've trimmed this right i i hope i did there's no way i made it that small i

59:04

don't know i was a lot of uncertainty back then oh

59:10

there's bat we just talked about basset yeah these expect bassett to do well so this isn't let's pull this one up too because this

59:15

is another um i think i feel like we just talked about this on monday

59:20

kind of a not a lower it's not a low risk play but it's home furnishings if residential

59:26

real estate is crashing it and i know it's like some stores are closed like that and because of the pandemic and everything like that but

59:32

this this seems like a decent play because it's got a strong balance sheet um and maybe i should buy more of it i

59:39

think i should i've been holding off but i've held off for similar reasons as ngs is that i thought

59:46

as i thought i don't know it's hard to explain like i not it wasn't getting much traction and not too many people were talking about it but um

59:54

what's that ngs what's going on here why does it keep refreshing and stuff sometimes it's half i think sometimes this happens midday because the tickers

1:00:00

are refreshing because what i had checked off is changing because the daily let's say the daily movers is moving around

1:00:06

oh it's it's here my bad oh good i must have unchecked everything i was wondering why there's so few tickers over there i forgot

1:00:14

you see what i mean what's this weird stuff showing other companies when it pops up like that bizarre but historically a decent

1:00:20

addition look at it so that just got dead but that's the damn leases but look at book value so it had book value about 15 bucks this is the thing i

1:00:27

it never got that no it did get down to f it was cheap at five bucks that was the thing and i um

1:00:35

the part of the issue was i didn't i thought it so i just i missed it well below five bucks it never got

1:00:40

that cheap like i it was traded at one third of book value but you see another out there taking like 10 book value at that time and um

1:00:52

like i always thought 34 bucks i looked at this for a while in march i looked at it for a while because i had

1:00:57

followed it for a long time too i think it's a total position as well they used to or it was they used to

1:01:03

dabble in that and um so you see the stromboli they never had any debt but it was well

1:01:08

run but there it was kind of just like they they were riding the residential real estate wave

1:01:15

um but then there's a question of okay well if if it starts throwing off losses even

1:01:20

look at historical earnings historical earnings were at a buck 60. you know what i mean so

1:01:26

10 times that's 16 bucks right just as a in your head but it's so well run but it's still just

1:01:32

a retail brick-and-mortar retailer but and there's a lot of home furnishings that are crushing it you know what i mean we were looking at kirkland right

1:01:37

that's why this came up that's why that was up too oh i know i just added that to missed

1:01:43

opportunities don't remind me it was somehow it was somehow another missed opportunity the past week

1:01:50

oh oh that one's painful but um i mean compare see what i mean

1:01:56

like comparatively so this is this one's up i don't know what is it up how many x it's up 10 11 12 x anyway and b

1:02:02

set is a double you know what i mean like so that was the right decision to not go super heavy into it for whatever

1:02:08

i just thought i just thought it didn't get that cheap and it didn't get that cheap because of the balance sheet um but the end of the day it's still

1:02:15

just a brick and mortar retailer but um

1:02:22

in the house they have cash flow you know what i mean so i talked about earnings but they had a pretty pretty some solid free cash flow of

1:02:28

close to two bucks per share so it at five bucks that's cheap but um i just didn't think it was as cheap and

1:02:34

now it's another way to play

1:02:39

i mean consumer discretionary demand for home furnishings which you could no it's got competition right it's gonna

1:02:45

leak them get home furnishings in many places to be honest i'm not sure how how popular this brand is this name

1:02:53

i haven't shopped there too much myself i know of it

1:02:59

but i tell you what i like what sticks out to me is how historically it was it seems like it was pretty well

1:03:05

run it's it's with with not that much dead it seems like they did a good job i like that that goes a long way with me

1:03:12

and they have it's cyclical you know what i mean so that was the thing i thought like i thought this cycle could drag on longer that was a thing but

1:03:18

i don't know i don't even know if i want to add it here you know what i mean ngs that's that's still trading quite a

1:03:24

bit below book but here i could see it doubling from here it's hard for me to see tripling

1:03:36

i don't know how do you get i can't it's hard for me to get the 25 30 bucks

1:03:44

it used to oh it pays a dividend they're still paying the dividend past 12 months wow did they did they cut it

1:03:51

did they cut the dividend i don't care i'm curious though right surely they cut

1:03:56

the dividend i don't know 15 bucks 12 bucks

1:04:05

revenue's declining you know what i mean but that's okay of course excuse me of course they're going to decline what am i seeing all right let's

1:04:11

just uh let's take a peek excuse me like ngs like almost like it's so super cheap right

1:04:16

oh and let me just pull that up again what were the margins on ngs look at the margins on ngs too that's

1:04:23

why i it remind like something that stuck out to me and i couldn't i forgot what we were looking at check out these net margins that is

1:04:29

sick in this in the um energy industry 10 10 plus these are three year averages but

1:04:35

still let me pull remember thinking what the hell that's dope um

1:04:40

even more reason to add you know what i mean they got a little bit of a competitive advantage there maybe it's not

1:04:45

sustainable for such a small company but i remember thinking like how the hell did they pull that off all this growth and stuff now

1:04:52

you know that dupont roe calculation right i mean that margin is one of those so that's at least part of the reason for their

1:04:58

their strong equity growth hey look at that remember dupont formula huh um

1:05:04

but uh and then but wow that's that's higher than i thought huh that's sick 10 15 percent

1:05:13

and simple free cash flow margin on my volatile operating cash flow margin 30 percent

1:05:21

wow you know what i mean 30 operating casual margin there's not you wouldn't think there's

1:05:27

that much capex requirement for this right you get a you're replacing some of your equipment

1:05:32

the compressors return on invested capital declining

1:05:38

over time i don't even remember how i defined that investor income divided by invested capital

1:05:44

i'm gonna have an idea right but i have like special special defined terms like investor income

1:05:49

that's probably net income plus interest expense the investors in the company

1:05:54

i mean you know what i mean um people who have provided capital roughly you know what

1:05:59

i've invested capital uh i probably should have a different probably do have a definition you know

1:06:05

what invested calories it was just the capital that's probably the total debt and shareholders equity and stuff

1:06:13

common and then investor oh there you go interest expense investor income there i have it defined see what i mean i haven't seen this one combinating

1:06:19

complex interest expense that's what i said i invested capitals tangible long-term assets so i have weird definitions for these things you could

1:06:25

google invested capital see how many ways you can calculate invested capital you know what i mean it's like so subjective so i just calculate as

1:06:31

tangible long-term assets i took total assets minus the intangibles and minus short-term um short-term assets

1:06:39

in minor short-term assets and i thought ah that's in the ballpark of capital so that's been declining over time which

1:06:44

you'd expect it's always going to come it's always going to come down to

1:06:49

the cost of capital for the company boy that's a pretty clean decline huh it's pretty clean

1:06:59

like uh like they're they're as as they're growing they're just not earning as much you know what i mean

1:07:05

and even revenues aren't even growing anymore just just stabilize but that can be a good as

1:07:10

long as you're still generating cash flow you know what i mean that's not bad

1:07:17

this is a buy i should have added more to this

1:07:23

when should i have added more

1:07:29

could have been adam this whole time under seven damn like that's why it's good to check those

1:07:36

fundamentals every couple every couple months really you think after every quarter of the release but i was tracking so many companies i

1:07:42

forgot how good this actually looked and because it was probably never a big daily mover you know what i mean it

1:07:47

probably wasn't probably it was never up five or ten percent of the day look it probably let's look at the daylight does it ever look like

1:07:53

yeah so man a couple days but everything was up those days

1:08:00

this is a buy damn it's a solid buy

1:08:08

okay i i just got sidetracked you know what i

1:08:14

mean i went back to all right back to b set back to b set where am i

1:08:22

okay uh all right check out the margins so the thin margins so you're gonna

1:08:27

expect these zero to five percent on the uh these retailers like this

1:08:34

tangible book value it's gonna be it's gonna be hard to post coven it's gonna be hard to get

1:08:41

back to these previous highs of but these assets are kind of in demand

1:08:47

you know what i mean any other type of retailer but home furnishings

1:08:55

a lot of competition out there what makes this company 110 kind of small being missed by a lot of people

1:09:01

it's smaller than ngs whoa that's the thing you might not you might not think it has the uh

1:09:09

the strength to to survive but that balance sheet's really strong they lose three bucks two bucks

1:09:18

still positive operating cash flow but you can see what could happen during the down years look i mean that that was a housing bubble though you know what i mean and still

1:09:24

they didn't lose that much yeah kind of they went from 18 bucks per share to nine bucks per share

1:09:30

in two years you know what i mean you can have huge but that's i feel like that's a little bit of an extreme

1:09:36

could still happen but the whole economy went bust

1:09:41

but i remember thinking no but bset's been coming down for a while you know what i mean saturn this is on his way

1:09:47

down this whole time that true

1:09:53

is that 30 bucks yeah 20 like i was going boom boom boom and i and then i was i was eyeing it late last year i was

1:09:58

and i remember thinking i don't even think i pulled the trigger i remember thinking you know it's just not that cheap

1:10:03

everything is not that cheap and i never pulled the trigger but i was watching and then i was like i think when it leaped up i'm like oh

1:10:09

i think that's how i kind of remember this i was like trying looking on september october everything it's just not cheap enough for me just not cheap

1:10:14

and then it leaped up and i'm like damn i messed up maybe it was cheap enough and then boom boom boom boom boom right

1:10:20

um five bucks was cheap six bucks just cheap

1:10:26

11 bucks

1:10:31

not that cheap you think

1:10:40

wait how did we get here how did we get on b set was it was it's in the portfolio right it's already there

1:10:45

okay okay okay that might be fine that might be fine so this is the thing

1:10:52

so um there's like there's upside in this downside right

1:10:57

and so as i'm looking through this i um it's it's not a safe play but it's on the safer side as balance sheet

1:11:03

balance sheet from the balance sheet perspective and yet still it's still a brick and mortar retailer and um

1:11:10

but the upside i don't see significant upside could be a double so it's hard for me to i don't know how

1:11:16

why would i put a percent in this when i could put a percent in a bunch of a bunch of this up up above it it's just hard for me like

1:11:23

i'd rather put it i'd even rather put an rfp i'd rather put an rfp at the current price point that i would i think in b

1:11:28

and b said i think so it's that's what i mean it's they're all trade-offs and uh it doesn't look compelling enough i mean

1:11:36

to pull the trigger on it but i'm glad we pulled it out and sorry was it was it did it release news that i don't even

1:11:41

i guess it doesn't matter that much who cares do you care i don't care this is probably good earnings or a good

1:11:46

outlook yeah they got they got clean storefronts i've driven by their stores before are they higher end too

1:11:54

oh they didn't report today what the hell they must have reported right

1:12:02

no what the hell is it up for

1:12:10

i don't know that seems like a big move for bassett

1:12:19

oh lazy boy furniture and home furnishings uh well right we saw kirk up today too

1:12:27

oh what was this june 3rd yeah encouraging conviction yeah i've seen stuff before june 3rd how much is it up

1:12:34

yeah it'll still look good still it's still a decent at seven bucks this was june so how did we what were we

1:12:39

thinking in june we were thinking um well things were getting

1:12:44

things were getting frisky and june around this time june 3rd a lot of stuff got bit up that next week

1:12:50

yeah seventy percent okay but let me just check this home

1:12:56

furnishings things yeah you'd excel like i couldn't like so long as those home builders and so long as that stuff's

1:13:01

taken off this stuff you'd think it's gonna follow suits that's what i mean if i wanted more exposure to it maybe i do

1:13:08

i've been trimming the home builders and you see what lumber prices are doing although when that crashes i'm not saying it's

1:13:14

gonna crash but not everything goes up every single day and usually things that go up

1:13:20

aggressively pull back aggressively not i mean to the degree is what you question

1:13:27

q2 eps estimates topping lazy boy haverty hooker

1:13:34

pass it oh hooker i've looked at hooker before too kirkland it says kirkland's up four percent but it was up way more than that

1:13:40

wasn't it oh i can't even look at home oh damn see what i mean

1:13:46

ah oh you know what you know what's funny about home i forgot i said this

1:13:51

i i remember i think i said this to my wife i've talked about home i already said it

1:13:57

was missed opportunity woe is me oh what is it 18

1:14:04

oh cliff cliff what's his name cliff sosan kaiser sose is his name

1:14:11

kaiser sose is it cliff sosen i don't even know

1:14:17

clifford citizen clifford sosan kaiser sosen maybe also i'll call

1:14:22

him so stupid oh this guy crushed it props

1:14:28

ah i i wimped out on this one i did i thought they were gonna go um i thought they weren't gonna make it i remember

1:14:33

saying to my wife like it was in march april we talked about a lot of stuff at this time right i i myself was looking at their website

1:14:40

thinking you know what they're probably gonna be having a ton of discounted stuff and and i told my pretty sure i told my wife they're probably going bankrupt so we

1:14:46

might get some super discounted stuff like home furnishing type stuff there's tons of stores out there too it's hard

1:14:51

to see how some of these have any particular competitive edge but um

1:14:57

i was wrong about that and i should have i should have trusted cliff and the same thing with prty

1:15:04

wow this one's crushed at that sec i was interested this when he was first buying i uh right around five and then it

1:15:11

pulled back and i was i was still watching right there and then when this happened i thought ah that's too bad

1:15:17

cliff got uh like damn wow that's a bummer

1:15:25

i mean i don't even want to look at these anymore anyway excuse me so you see how that's performed and then you wonder

1:15:33

i mean that's performed so aggressively so these are some one of the more speculative plays on home furnishings same thing with kirkland these are all

1:15:39

the more speculative plays and these are already 10 baggers is it conceivable these are going to take out their previous highs you know

1:15:45

what i mean like are you when did was he first buying

1:15:50

home yeah he was buying a good prices so he probably figured

1:15:57

15 20 at least i guess he could have thought five bag or maybe i looked at the numbers the numbers don't look that compelling

1:16:04

bummer all right do i do i wanna maybe i'll

1:16:13

i'll give it some more thought add to be set as

1:16:20

relatively as lower risk play on

1:16:25

home i mean on homes home furnishings right but okay all right anything else here well

1:16:31

it's 816 but we're like digging into companies and stuff you know what i mean oh horoscope i don't need this was one of those companies i didn't know that well but i

1:16:37

added in march and april when i was pouring over everything and i'm like oh this looks like i could be a good fit for the portfolio

1:16:43

and now i don't even know what it does never get on the dollar zero because the construction right

1:16:49

i think let's pull it up oh let's check the business oh i gotta pull that business over how many times i got

1:16:56

what's it do environmental solutions for industrial and specialty waste streams and innovative equipment and technology

1:17:02

for the rail sector worldwide what what

1:17:10

on-site services of material logistics product quality improvement and resources resource recovery for okay so it's a

1:17:15

it's a it's a way to play commodity so that's probably what caught my attention right oh some insider buying you kind of know

1:17:22

you know you kind of know what's going to catch my attention 700 700 000 look at march

1:17:27

they had seven march too that that's what probably got it on my radar march and then i dug in i go yep that fits the

1:17:33

bill wait what's that right now about 14.

1:17:40

i have to pull this back so on the chart oh look how low it got in 2016 let's see industrial that's what i

1:17:46

mean oh something's traded lower some of those industrials didn't quite get as

1:17:52

well same thing with tack and all them this doesn't look that up it doesn't compelling on the upside wait let's i'll

1:17:57

pull up the fundamentals for this one because i don't i don't really know it off the top of my head it's probably done its job it's really

1:18:02

good you've you've done your duty harsco of what i was trying to accomplish when i invested in you

1:18:09

help me diversify get exposure to industrial industrial machinery and um and you tripled

1:18:15

job well done i probably didn't get the full triple you probably doubled for me

1:18:25

oh that'll come out okay um you know what i should do so those are those are re

1:18:33

those are re-running the reports because i just interrupted the list because it got added in the mail when i

1:18:38

checked it off i got added to the middle of the list but i wonder if i can have it add to the bottom of the list that way it doesn't have to rerun the report

1:18:44

every time it's not a big deal who cares who cares five seconds chill kid chill

1:18:57

yeah what does it matter because i wouldn't be looking at that company anymore anyway hc i should oh look at and i like the

1:19:02

size of the company too 1 billion in revs negative tangible book value

1:19:10

purple green in the past at least you had purple and green at some point you know what i mean

1:19:16

did they stop the dividend look at these numbers like no earnings like uh messy earnings for a period

1:19:21

there maybe they were cleaning up the company though i don't know a lot of debt though with with declining

1:19:27

revenues oh big jump in revenues this year huh the hell cool could

1:19:33

would we say rail this is a good example of

1:19:39

sorry you can't see that that was just me um trying to pull up this google search so i could pull up

1:19:44

the hell they do like sometimes i'll just go to the front page of the website

1:19:55

clean earth what the hell clean earth huh hey nice nice pictures

1:20:02

it looks kind of sick i wonder where that is nice

1:20:12

harsh color okay so the the the rails just one aspect of what are they what they do our company what do you do

1:20:19

it's not compelling enough for me to dive in deep this is going to be like a two minute

1:20:25

like i don't see i don't see anything on the on the fundamentals that catches my eye or um or in the chart i mean i see this

1:20:32

six dollars in earnings but that's probably just to hit that just uh i see the cash flow here operating cash flow two bucks

1:20:38

simple free cash flow the peak was ten years ago this makes you wonder if there you see what did it spin off was there a

1:20:44

spin-off here because that's a huge decline this is the thing the commodity a commodity bubble

1:20:50

if you ask me some people disagree most people agree with that though right

1:20:55

and so probably its assets were super in favor so i wouldn't expect this necessarily to be repeatable

1:21:02

even then earnings topped out at 3.75 that's not that much did it spin out look at the decline

1:21:07

though it's been it's over over 50 down it's not that for such a big company it's kind of surprising

1:21:14

i don't have something compelling so can you just remind me what you do like in more it's something i understand

1:21:21

better i'm not too smart i'm not a smart man i understand some of those words i

1:21:27

understand those words okay processing treatment disposer and recycling solutions for a wide range of

1:21:34

complex highly recurring waste streams okay they get rid of some waste for which industries

1:21:40

just general industrials is that it okay recycling and disposal solutions okay

1:21:45

that's not a bad business i like that stereocycle oh they purchased

1:21:52

stereocycle this year i know that company how much they pay for that

1:22:00

oh wait they said this year i see it as a big purchase last year

1:22:08

right um now i'm trying to look up that net

1:22:14

acquisitions damn this offset i really screwed it when i was building these when i was building these fundamental spreadsheets i was trying to

1:22:21

i was cleaning up one spreadsheet right so i was like try i was like i was just trying to get

1:22:27

everything in one view and then i was trying to resize it so that we could kind of look at this stuff together here i am still blocking it kind of

1:22:32

but um and then i'm like all right and then i just duplicated duplicated duplicated the tab duplicated the

1:22:37

spreadsheets and i'm like i'm such an idiot i'm like oh i forgot to clean up this i forgot to scroll over because i

1:22:44

figured most times i'd just be focused on this but i have to say i've been scrolling over much more than i usually do looking at those individual years

1:22:51

um but usually i'm just trying to grab the 10 trend with these three year averages but whatever um

1:22:57

okay so was that this column right here the net acquisitions and divestitures i just want to see the shared dollar amount

1:23:04

584 million wow that's a big acquisition what's that what's the market cap

1:23:10

it's only one billion that's a big acquisition or was it a merger or vehicles or something

1:23:16

it's hard to expand clean sugar wow all right i like that business model

1:23:23

though wait where's the other businesses oh

1:23:29

material processing and environmental solutions to the global steel and metals industry all right that's really all i

1:23:34

need to know material i mean i don't know exactly what that processing materials

1:23:41

um they're importer exporters you know what i mean they're importer exporters

1:23:46

uh bill servers and resource recovery all right all right all right i just need to know

1:23:52

what drives the profits and stuff first goes right now is for technical leadership blah blah blah just rails okay it's like a it's like a

1:23:59

it's like a good industrial company you know what i mean but i don't i don't i can't find the upside can't find can't find it

1:24:05

i'm looking i don't see it could be some transformational thing happen behind the scenes that's cool

1:24:12

there's something someone talking about it but otherwise i think i might sell out you know what i mean i see this or then

1:24:18

i see ngs i think nts easy okay who's this harsco company

1:24:24

rebranding is winning for next six months will be crucial ouch february 27th

1:24:30

nope no one commented on it so i oh stephen simpson what'd he say

1:24:38

okay cleaner should make cars go less cyclical over the long term i can see that right because it's um it's waste

1:24:45

and rail still has plenty of room for improvement the steel business is still vital to the business look under value below 20 but the street

1:24:51

will likely need much more confidence in a near-term bottom and steel yep he got it looks like he got this right he's he pretty much knows his

1:24:57

i don't always agree with him on certain stock picks though bullish and bearish both sides ones we one we really agreed on though

1:25:03

was um was it cvgi does he i forgot i think he may written on cbgi

1:25:10

um he actually thought fair value was higher than what i thought it was like he thought it was if i i remember this because i've looked at cvgi multiple times talked about on

1:25:16

the stream a number of times i remember he thought cvg i looked compelling at seven or eight bucks and i'm thinking really i don't see it at

1:25:22

seven or eight bucks and so but in the back of my mind i know he's he likes it and he looks at a ton of

1:25:27

companies i don't even know this guy i don't know i just know that it's d it's decent analysis i know what i'm getting when i

1:25:33

read it that he he uh he's he's looking at he's looking at important stuff he kind of gets it

1:25:38

um but um i don't know where i was going with that so when i see him say all right this

1:25:44

looks like that might not be that compelling at this price i think all right that's that's what i'm seeing too so

1:25:49

that's my quick take if not the specifics of the valuation stuff just the business and um it's reassuring and i can do it

1:25:56

it's a quick rule of thumb for me thank you steven simpson i get them bookmarked here i think

1:26:02

that's the thing i saw where is it i don't remember funds or something

1:26:08

analysts i should fill this out that's just a couple of them um all right but i think it's quality

1:26:15

business and i think the long-term returns from the deal will offset that initial cost of entry cool that's good to know i also have concerns that a weak

1:26:20

sentiment for steel and steel related stocks will weigh on those okay really thinks it's tied to steel

1:26:27

patient investors may want to use this pullback as an opportunity for due diligence in perhaps starting a position yeah cool that was only trading on what

1:26:34

16. no no comments on it no one cares no one cares i care i looked oh he has one

1:26:40

there's one like by tom i don't know okay

1:26:46

i'm gonna sell that's it

1:26:52

how big is the position and this will be this way i can raise some cash

1:27:02

whatever i i think i have it in some other accounts too um

1:27:09

i definitely like that as an industry it's fun so like i'm saying that now like that's clearly what i had seen at the time even though i couldn't remember

1:27:15

and uh but now it doesn't serve as it doesn't serve the purpose i needed for i want something more compelling at this point i um

1:27:24

would regal this is a this is a biotech this inviting i got in here those aren't

1:27:30

considered i consider them unrelated to the rest of this um like the my typical stocks that i'm

1:27:36

dabbling in um they're related to nash and stuff that that industry looks compelling

1:27:42

it's they're all speculative though these are speculative biotechs they haven't even they don't have any approved drugs or anything like that but

1:27:48

um one i think could be compelling um air cap i could start trimming this even

1:27:55

more too that's like kind of a safe way

1:28:00

i think it's probably worth double what it is let me pull up those this is good i should probably spend a

1:28:07

damn stream just going through all these damn companies you know what i mean i hate that i keep clicking around i wish these were like different color

1:28:12

tabs i wish i could change the color of the tab they're all the green they're all green to me you know what i mean i'm not

1:28:18

reading the name i'm just going boom boom boom sorry about that click up open up air cap oh you know what let me

1:28:25

clear these out make some space oh what's western digital doing coming back down

1:28:31

[Music] air cap oh i added to fpe here you go and then you see it up at

1:28:36

half a percent uh i did make that note right add to pay i remember we looked at it

1:28:44

i should i wish i had more and that's the thing i can't be wasting time taking too many notes um i should like i remember remember we

1:28:51

looked at it then our first look compelling because i think the fundamentals weren't the right numbers and stuff but then it wasn't as compelling but the

1:28:57

insider buying was super bullish and that guy oh that guy bought again by the way that's what reminded me

1:29:03

he bought um yeah he bought again it came today did i pull the trigger today i think i pulled the trigger today and um

1:29:10

and i i pulled it up and went oh yeah i got it i got to buy f pay and then i pulled up the note and everything that's what i mean that's been helpful

1:29:16

and i think i doubled the position i doubled i think it was like point two point now it's a point five i um another 100k it's no joke

1:29:25

so i like that anyway that was just the next one on the list there

1:29:30

i just saw that so i'm pulling a bear cap damn i this one was a vr tv

1:29:37

what i should be doing what am i doing i don't know what i'm doing right now i'm kind of just scrolling i was looking at the movers and stuff but now i'm kind of looking at should i trim like

1:29:43

should i trim these what should i do with these

1:29:49

hope you don't mind i'm because i don't know what i'm doing right now but now because i saw the cash was so low and i'm

1:29:54

i'm at it i added to ontario and sandridge and i wanted to add to rfp but now i'm

1:30:02

waiting for a pullback i i money i'm not even wanting to add the thing about cnr

1:30:07

i'm trying to think off the top of my head my top positions i'd like those insiders to buy right now why aren't those inside response you know because the insiders are smart

1:30:14

they've been doing a great job buying at discount prices they never bought above um

1:30:21

they never bought above well i wasn't really watching it that closely back here whoa 700k yeah james metcalf

1:30:30

said like they only buy seven and below it seems they're doing a real good job about that but now they're seven they're not buying

1:30:35

but i'll tell you what if they if they pulled the trigger i'd buy more um but it's kind of

1:30:41

it's speculative that i feel kind of comfortable with this but it i also think it could be like a four bagger and it's a play on

1:30:47

residential real estate i kind of like it for that reason anyway this is my thing i'm like trying to think about getting this cache up

1:30:55

um all right so i just pulled up aircad i think aircap

1:31:02

x out of some of these things did i say seller yeah sell htc

1:31:11

i'm not doing anything with silver or gold yet i'm just going to wait it out bzh i'll keep that up there that's like my one remaining

1:31:17

all the big ones i've trimmed and i'm like ah if this keeps running on bzh will do good and do i still have hove do i still have

1:31:23

it up there i got it in some other that's the thing so this roaring kitty portfolio right but i have some of these

1:31:28

in some other accounts and some of them have been huge winners because i was more they were fewer

1:31:33

positions and more evenly diversified across all of them and i had things like hov and pen national gaming

1:31:38

and in camping world they were like bigger positions bigger percentages of those portfolios with

1:31:44

those accounts and they were up like like they were legit like 10 baggers or or six baggers seven baggers

1:31:50

and uh it's kind of funny like i'm like oh yeah i forgot this was in here but i start with hov i got really lucky on the timing of

1:31:56

that one and there's like a handful of them or i'm like oh i got real lucky at that time because i i legit did for many of those

1:32:03

i pulled the trigger on march 23rd like i was sitting waiting and most of those were in cash those

1:32:08

other not all of them but a handful my just had them sitting like at that point they'd already taken a hit make no mistake i wasn't sitting in cash since

1:32:14

like january or anything like that but at some point in march i'm like oh that's it let's just now we just gotta wait i

1:32:20

wasn't trying to time the bottom or anything i'm like i just needed to wait i don't know what i was waiting for it's kind of hard to some of the other videos

1:32:26

i try to talk about it but anyway and then on march 23rd i'm like that was deployed the cash across all the accounts

1:32:32

and uh and so a lot of the prices were march 23rd price which wasn't the low for a lot for most of the most of my names it

1:32:38

wasn't the low march 18th was the low but it was low enough for sitting on like seven baggers like

1:32:44

eight baggers ten bags like oh my i wish i did it more for this for this portfolio uh the home builders

1:32:51

were big winners i had a bunch of home builders in there which turned out to be sick um

1:32:57

yeah anyway but um why would i just talk about that oh cause hov was one of them because i'm like all right that's my

1:33:02

most that's one of my most speculative home builder and uh and it was up like five six i forget 6x or something

1:33:08

i missed a lot too right you hear me talk about missed opportunities but i got a lot of them too um but now hov was super risky for the

1:33:16

roaring kitty portfolio so i bzh beezer is like a kind of a higher kind of a slightly

1:33:22

kind of a bit of a better play but okay going off on tangents now and new home new home is an interesting one too i

1:33:28

wish they were buying though okay so so i should be looking at this

1:33:33

buying right now too by the way i'm pulling up the fundamentals because i'm guessing i guess i'm trying to get my my feet wet with them again

1:33:39

but i should be looking at this is what these damn numbers are in here for you know what i mean this is what i'd be sorting by that's what i'm going to do

1:33:44

let's do that let's do that today i haven't done that yet this is really sick because i want this stuff like this is a really

1:33:51

yeah let's start what the hell is we gonna do today anything what agenda who has an agenda we got no

1:33:58

agenda um let me just think we'll look at the

1:34:04

daily movers and we'll let's okay let's do let's check insiders because i saw a little bit of action today

1:34:09

this i might not be checking the market every day but i'm like i'm kind of just always checking this

1:34:15

oh fat they get some insider buying oh that guy oh that's a really small amount though

1:34:23

yeah they went heavy they went heavy in november two guys right three guys three guys oh i thought it

1:34:29

was two guys i mean i think the the i think this is this is the same firm or something like

1:34:34

that right are they all the same they just did a bond exchange too

1:34:43

i bought in at 20 cents i got i got i was like a quick triple

1:34:48

super speculative super speculative i like i bought in that like i should

1:34:54

have been buying other stuff too but i was watching this real close i forgot why and i freaking bought in at 19 cents was

1:35:00

that boom boom boom boom boom but super red i mean the chart looks

1:35:06

like it looks terrible but that insider buying was so attractive i'm like what the hell i

1:35:12

thought i assumed like this chart it looks like it's going bankrupt and then that bond exchange i think they pulled it off so they were able to get

1:35:18

rid of some covenants that's not much of a buy though that's real small it's something though when did he do it

1:35:25

oh it says he did it august 18th you know who else saw something on that

1:35:31

was that what's his name um tim oh a bearish one look at that

1:35:39

what's his name um that was probably here so you can check the comments timothy tell me something

1:35:53

timothy stop i don't know how to pronounce this suppose he was not many people were talking about so i was kind of surprised when i said uh so someone i

1:35:58

uh

1:36:05

okay this was what's the august 19 dog said nonsense good time everyone thought it would skyrocket after the deal got done yep i was watching the deal closely

1:36:12

which is why it reversed and sold off instead sit and wait two dollars is not an overnight thing anyway but one dollar is

1:36:17

reasonable over the next six months substantially added late last week oh okay so he was still adding

1:36:24

who else was talking about this energy and i don't know him i don't agree with timothy on um

1:36:31

many stocks but i i would i read his analysis i know where he's coming from from some things

1:36:37

and um he's a deep value investor you know what i mean if you're a deep value investor and i've and you've you've done good analysis on other

1:36:43

companies even if i don't agree with the take or i don't i don't invest alongside you um i will still

1:36:50

follow your analysis and look at stuff like this so then when there's that obscure stock that no one else is paying attention to if you're paying attention

1:36:55

to it okay all right there's something here that a deep value investor sees uh and we may both be wrong about fet

1:37:02

but uh i'm surprised that this stock is on it manipulation and height scc needs to be involved

1:37:08

i still think it will touch all right i don't know

1:37:14

oh we've got a couple of them kind of bring me up to speed fy adding to my position in the low 50s today

1:37:20

to bring this back up to it yeah i kind of remember him being like more bullish than i was it's it's super

1:37:25

speculative but that insider buying was good can someone explain the ins and the

1:37:31

ounces the conversion feature and the potential for the dilution yeah that sounds like a question i would ask too i'm not i i'm not experts on those types

1:37:38

of things fyi add him back all right he made his decision

1:37:43

yeah i mean that's kind of bullish for it he's um i mean he's gotten some stuff he's he's been he's aggressive he's more

1:37:49

bullish than i am on some things but here i'm now going to pull up the fundamentals for that one

1:37:58

wait a second it's in here right no we came up

1:38:04

wait is it even in the portfolio

1:38:17

small i actually think it used to be bigger

1:38:23

i had invested in this beforehand too not uh as an energy position i had

1:38:28

energy exposure so i got i mean this i got hit too by a lot of these energy positions selling off but i had some

1:38:34

fat too knowing it was a risky position and that it would get crushed if anything came up so

1:38:41

i don't know i may have sold out pop back in but i was it's definitely right now is is below

1:38:47

when i first purchased it i'll tell you that much um

1:38:52

yeah i think i was might have been getting involved in this dollar range between 1.50

1:38:59

they were the insider buying i would the insider buying kind of caught my attention and you see the chart chart looks terrible i mean even i wouldn't touch this i

1:39:05

wasn't touched i'm like oh no look at this thing just waiting waiting and then when i saw the

1:39:11

20 cents i'm like well it's either going bankrupt which is a strong possibility or it could be a big winner and now it's

1:39:17

only a 50 cents that's really not that it's not that much of a bounce i wish the insiders would buy more well

1:39:22

i already pulled up the fundamentals we'll take a peek but i need to check the news on that bond exchange too

1:39:28

i mean i read it at the time but is there any update i think they successfully completed it all right so he's bullish on it that's

1:39:33

all i need to know all right let's check those funds would

1:39:38

they waiting on some fundamentals on oh air count all right paul bearcat i own twitter at um at one point i got a

1:39:46

solid not that big of a more like 25 30 percent on it i just thought i i still think it looks

1:39:52

what is it eight bucks what's it trading at i think i bought it like

1:40:02

i would have bought it at um

1:40:07

did i get it in the 30s no i want to say i bought it in like 35 36 and then i like sold out

1:40:13

because i think i found more i think i like sold out right before this thing so i don't know what the hell i was doing i

1:40:19

just thought the fundamentals were kind of bullish and then well and then i think if they ever turn the spigot on they tried to make some money off it they probably could

1:40:25

and then when did it sell off was this news that they weren't going to do political no because that was later

1:40:31

wasn't i don't know it doesn't matter just got my attention all right air cap

1:40:40

wait welcome that didn't come on i'll check it off later yeah super leveraged uh yeah who was

1:40:46

that uh jeremy raper he was blue's bullish on this it would pull shawna like higher up but i couldn't see it i couldn't see it the

1:40:53

leverage it's like it looks like it's a well-run business that's probably what he was seeing um but the leverage

1:41:03

strong earnings strong earnings and that's the thing so some of these some of the investors i might agree with them

1:41:08

part of the reasons just because we have different styles of investing um and my style is just like a deep

1:41:14

value dish different style and so again that's what i mean like i could disagree i mean if i disagree with the value deep

1:41:20

value investor that's one thing but i may disagree with other people and it's just because they have a different style investing they're trying to just maybe they're trying to get a 50 or

1:41:27

maybe just trying to get 50 or 100 on a solid company in which case this could be a perfect fit i i don't have the i don't know it's

1:41:33

just not for for me i don't see it for me that's that's all i mean um that's why in general it's you got to

1:41:39

be careful critiquing others work because you could be playing two different games you know what i mean if that makes sense um so i usually i'm not critiquing other

1:41:47

people sometimes i can tell if analysis isn't good someone like jeremy raper is a terrific analyst um probably i mean that's what i

1:41:53

mean probably better than me i think he said he knows his credit analysis should too but um but for me i have the returns i'm

1:42:00

trying to get i i couldn't see it without cap

1:42:06

but for like i know some people like com i don't know about yeah other bit like people like compounders and stuff you want those companies that are going to

1:42:11

crush it over 10 years and like i know that's like the buffett weight too and but isn't that super

1:42:18

difficult i feel like that's way hard like i would never have the conviction in my maybe

1:42:23

i would never have the conviction of my analysis of an industry in a and plenty of people do this by the way

1:42:28

i'm just and they're successful but i remember in the early days reading i read all the buffett books and all that

1:42:34

stuff right and compounding and blah blah blah i just thought if buffett i if buffer that's buffett's

1:42:42

style right now it's hugely successful that's the thing even the he was buying in the 90s and buying coca-cola those are big companies and they're still

1:42:47

huge great companies you can clearly see there's definitely a legitimate strategy there but i remember thinking like if he were

1:42:54

younger and he didn't have as much capital he wouldn't be doing that like that's not those aren't the companies you were buying and so why would i be buying that

1:43:00

stuff i maybe i'll work up to that point you know but right now i'm going for i'm going for 50 to 100 and if you're

1:43:07

going for a 50 100 i feel like it's a tough i feel like it's tougher to be going compounders maybe people

1:43:13

disagree i i don't know but um if you're making 50 100 and you're investing in compounders

1:43:19

i i'd love i'd love to i'd love to see that because i'd be so curious about your process and your style and stuff and uh

1:43:26

that's just so it seems so tough to me and i i just think there are i think the alternatives are superior i

1:43:31

my my personally i don't know maybe in years i'll i'll think now you know what that what i was doing wasn't worth the let's

1:43:39

say the emotional toll it takes on some people i feel like it takes less of a toll on me but um which could be part of the edge

1:43:45

but maybe i'll look back and i'll be like nah that wasn't really worth it that what i had to do or maybe looking at these spreadsheets right now

1:43:51

i don't know so i keep an open mind about this stuff i do and so that's a long way of saying

1:43:59

i just couldn't see it with aircraft so i got it don't get me wrong i got it the roaring kitty portfolio i would say in general i'm taking a little bit less

1:44:05

risk because for example you're not going to see any uh call options position well you might actually

1:44:11

um usually like the calls that i'm buying are are outside of this running kitty

1:44:17

portfolio but um but in this in this itself it's usually a little bit less risk but

1:44:23

and at 30 air cap was trading like 10 bucks i i mentioned that in one of those one of those super crazy long

1:44:31

videos and i saw it this day this was the 18th and i said what and i thought now it's cheap sick and i

1:44:37

put in the order at like 11 that day so i didn't i didn't pull the trigger and everything but air cap i

1:44:42

was um not dialed into but watching pretty closely because i was so impressed by this sell-off i'm like what the hell

1:44:48

what the hell what the hell what the hell and i put in the order and it didn't get executed i'm like what and then it closed at 15 and i was

1:44:55

pissed that i was like what the hell um everything was down low and then up that day and

1:45:01

then it was up the next day then i was like boom boom boom boom boom and i i feel like i i bought it 18 or something and it's cheap eddie it was cheap at it

1:45:08

it was cheap at 10 that's my that's what i was waiting for um and you can wait

1:45:13

what i find with these levered companies is that you just wait it's like it's not my it's not a good fit for me right now but

1:45:19

um what do they say in london you want to wait for it to not rain or rain wait 10 minutes or

1:45:24

something like that that's how i feel with these levered companies i'm like oh yeah that could be a good fit for me if if it takes it on the chin and then it

1:45:30

sells off because so this was a great opportunity to buy it because if it if it is indeed such a well-run company

1:45:35

then at 15 bucks it's a no-brainer but even still it's only a double from there you know what i mean so i mean it

1:45:40

could bump back to 60. but then there's the whole risk of the industry it's above i i

1:45:46

i stop offense a lot of airlines and i guess i'm and now i'm guess i carry it

1:45:51

was with uh what raper thinks about it i haven't been following it that closely i assume he's still bullish on this

1:45:57

right you got to be but what about the long term the risks associated with this i don't know i

1:46:04

but boy what's the earnings who's that yeah trades it half a book what's the earnings deal down there

1:46:10

26 that's not bad that's cheap that's cheap

1:46:22

i mean i don't want i don't want that's the thing even though we're kind of a little bit out of the woods for march and april it's not like i want to layer

1:46:27

on all these super risky positions at this point you know what i mean then you'll know what will happen is the market will come right back and it will

1:46:33

give back all the gains i'll look like an idiot so that's what i mean like a position like air cap is a good position because

1:46:38

i kind of i i kind of trust raper that his analysis of this company i i doubt he would mess this up

1:46:45

i need to check up on his updated analysis i should look into that can i

1:46:54

do it right now he doesn't post on

1:47:00

he's got his blog i think i gotta go check that out oh i get don't i have a um

1:47:07

oh he had oh that was may avoid air cap

1:47:12

i had seen his analysis on um gamestop but i didn't think it was that bad i thought it was okay

1:47:20

wow oh well this looks like this looks prescient it's flat since this article oh i'd have

1:47:26

to read this too okay

1:47:31

oh too bad right comment on this that'd be that would get right to the point

1:47:51

yeah that was just so i see this in january and stuff oh here you go yeah does he put does he talk about uh

1:47:57

erica oh here it is oh he's got a new thing there

1:48:02

oh yeah it doesn't have like a pro thing now oh does that mean he's not posting about these oh that's a bummer

1:48:10

all right maybe i'll look into this later i was just hoping i could um oh

1:48:18

my catching up on again that was me okay so this is me this might work

1:48:23

anything in here to gain access ah bummer all right i guess that's over

1:48:30

too bad yeah no he's uh he's a good analyst damn that's a shame

1:48:36

all right i guess i'm passing on an aircraft what's the market gap

1:48:45

four billion see it's not that small either i could read this i'm not gonna read this now but maybe i'll check it check

1:48:50

it out later what's the chart doing kind of just bumbling around doing nothing

1:49:01

the debt i don't know what you're saying what are the bonds doing what i mean trades at a big a discount

1:49:07

to book and uh it's first of all it's just too big it's just too big four billion i'm not a added

1:49:15

i can't uh that's what i mean am i parking cash that's it i need to decide uh if i need to raise cash but i still

1:49:21

want to have the exposure maybe i'll put an air cap that's the thing but this the debt

1:49:26

it could be it fell to ten dollars you know what i mean that's crazy but it was temporary paper losses right

1:49:32

no it was at 20 bucks in no time so that's not that big i'm exaggerating hyperbole to scare

1:49:37

myself out of it uh

1:49:43

all right at least i just feel like i looked into it i just ah the numbers broke they'll come

1:49:50

back i don't know

1:49:57

yeah why did you break it on me now is it such a well-run business return on

1:50:04

invested account but all that don't look that great here i'm just gonna look at those net

1:50:09

margins though sick yeah i mean they're leasing their planes right oh twenty percent we talk about ten percent twenty

1:50:14

percent all right this is a good business so yeah return invested capital might be declining with it's gonna happen as you

1:50:19

grow revenue's still growing as i recall that first of all i'm pretty sure i would just trust raper blindly on the quality

1:50:25

of the management team in the hi in the history of the business because i he's as i recall he was definitely more dialed in to me donald into it than i am

1:50:31

but i'm just trying to see what he was seeing and i see the strong solid equity growth that's terrific you know who also i

1:50:37

think on this was green light capital i think they were the ones who put it on my radar first back it would it

1:50:43

it leaped up it was like wasn't there like an acquisition or a merger or something it like leaked up one day and never

1:50:48

looked back here i remember this day

1:50:54

i remember that wow geez that was december 2013. like overnight went from uh 20 and that

1:51:01

was at 40. and that was it and i never looked back i feel like it was a merger or something or and then it

1:51:06

came back down 2016. i did i own it i may have bought it i may have bought it around there

1:51:12

because i had been following it because this part of these were my earlier earlier years but it never got that

1:51:17

cheap and then you got it down to 10 that's crazy but the chart kind of is indicating a

1:51:23

solid growth but some some pullbacks at times but it's that's going to be the nature of that type of a business

1:51:34

net margin so 20 no that's no joke that's no joke

1:51:44

23 percent wait a second how come i only have through 2019 what the hell is that

1:51:51

this is you oh is it no it's not a u.s company is it damn is it iron is it ireland oh it's ireland

1:51:57

isn't it i'm kind of missing these six months damn all right

1:52:06

oh so book value could be lower couldn't it damn it what we got for now let me just

1:52:11

calculate book real quick do we got equity

1:52:18

what is this this is billions wow big company huh that's what i mean i'll be dealing in like this sweet spot

1:52:25

of market caps right say from like 100 to 300 million or something like that and

1:52:30

then when i go lower i get thrown off when i go higher i get turned off i'm like wait a second what the hell is this and this is a bit bigger than i'm usually dealing

1:52:35

all right so wait equities holding up pretty well i can see it right there they didn't they didn't have they didn't have to do any right downs or anything

1:52:41

like that or are they coming i don't know buffett's selling his

1:52:47

airlines boy that weighs on me huh

1:52:53

i mean and just the sheer risk of it i i feel like there's a lot of investors out there who are kind of blindsided by the

1:53:01

first of all it's not like i've i thought through this i didn't think through this all i did was like these airlines and these

1:53:06

airline related companies it's just the just the level of debt like the i didn't think through that

1:53:12

something could happen to the airlines and that they would go fault use of the airlines would fall

1:53:17

from like ninety percent to zero percent i never thought like that i know who thought that was actually going to happen i didn't think that but i when i see a super leveraged company

1:53:24

um and these are all super leveraged companies even air cap well run though i mean if you're going to deal on one you want one that's well run but when

1:53:31

you have that much leverage if things if things you get a hiccup or something look out forget about it you can trade you can

1:53:36

buy them way cheaper and you started in airlines and just so happened it was like the pandemic that caused it but

1:53:42

i would just never feel super comfortable with those plays and there were so many people and of course buffett was buying the

1:53:47

airlines too so that was helping the narrative but i couldn't i could never see it maybe people made lots of money on the

1:53:53

upside too you know what i mean i tell you the trade the trade for airlines on an airlines kick right now

1:53:58

the trade for airlines was 2013 2014 because it was a hedge against oil prices and as oil is the cost

1:54:04

that's an input for the airlines right as those decline is oil prices dropped let's pull up a chart i mean i've looked

1:54:10

at this before so the um we're going to see that they they crushed it

1:54:15

i mean a lot of value crushed it right there but um look at this it went from seven dollars

1:54:22

to forty dollars and if we look at the price of

1:54:27

watch oh watch this chart i can probably overlay them not quite that well they went up that is

1:54:32

they were riding the value train so it didn't go up quite as strongly oh that's because this is throwing it off damn

1:54:39

what if i do um etf yeah well you get the idea this this

1:54:46

recent thing has really thrown off these charts quite a bit but um that was the time that was the trade that was the trade

1:54:52

from from those recession like bare rare slows to here that's it there was nothing here nothing i could

1:54:58

see again style everyone has their own style i'm not criticizing anyone who's doing that but for me personally my style

1:55:05

in this particular case helped me because i just all that leverage i just couldn't i

1:55:10

didn't touch anything i own nothing in that front um and in this case it it helped me i

1:55:16

got i guess i got lucky but i just feel like that's a good rule of thumb if you're dealing with something leveraged you better be prepared for it to crash or

1:55:22

have people have stop losses too i'm not saying like people are crushed by this i'm just saying it appears as though the upside was much

1:55:28

more limited than people realized even even more than i realized um and now with their cap at 30 bucks i think i don't

1:55:34

know this things could have changed and i'm not really sure i'm not smart enough to know but it looks cheap i mean it definitely

1:55:41

deserves to be in the portfolio um based on those numbers only twenty percent now mars is two that's sick i

1:55:48

mean airplane they're not going away airplanes people that's how we travel um

1:55:55

but it's just not cheap enough for me also there was one there was one there

1:56:00

was an airline this is um there was an airline that

1:56:06

i was interested in it was hawaiian airlines it turned out to be a 10 bagger you always remember you always remember

1:56:11

these ten bags it went from five to fifty i did not capture a full ten bagger i honestly forget i

1:56:20

i forget if i actually pulled the trigger on i remember yeah i don't remember but i was dialed

1:56:26

into it it looked cheap on it it was trading it like a low price to book that's all and this this was my early years right i didn't

1:56:32

really know much i probably still don't the me in the future gonna look be like what the hell are you talking about

1:56:38

but um it turned out to be a temperature and i crushed it but all value was crushing around this time anyway oil prices came down these went up that

1:56:45

was the trade um they weren't compounders though and now air cap i'm not so sure

1:56:57

but i'm okay with it in that portfolio forum i don't know did i pulled up those fundamentals right what are we waiting

1:57:04

on didn't i

1:57:12

oh i didn't no because it's it's more about the story it's more about that bond exchange

1:57:32

oh i could have just right clicked and searched that i think okay what'd they say here this i'll check

1:57:38

i didn't read this they're earning i'm sure it was bad sure it was a bad revenue of 113 net

1:57:44

loss cash flow of operations fund okay negative cash flow but not as much as

1:57:49

you may have thought six million total cash burn decrease of 69 million adjusted ebitda

1:57:57

i need to hear the quote okay chris by the way he's chairman and ceo that's why it was meaningful when he

1:58:02

bought as much as he did and that's why it's kind of meaningful he bought 60k but it's nothing he needs to buy more this location caused by covid collapse

1:58:09

energy demand a little ongoing work for complete with little ongoing work for drilling and completion right no surprise there

1:58:15

in response to these challenges our management team moved swiftly to restructure the committed weather storm

1:58:20

early in the same quarter we completed significant structural cost reductions

1:58:26

our results result like the impact blah blah blah blah blah in a year over i mean they have to say this stuff i'm just

1:58:32

on a year-over-year basis the cost reductions on an annualized basis are close to 150 that seems like a lot for this

1:58:37

smaller company did they really do that all right the market has like 60

1:58:46

55 yeah something like this could be a 10 bagger you know what i mean that's what i thought at 20 cents

1:58:55

but even from here it could still be a 10 bagger it could also go bankrupt

1:59:00

i'll tell you the chart says it's going to go back a longer term chart says bankruptcy but that's the thing you need to look for a

1:59:05

management team that's trying you know what i mean sometimes you'll see uh they're not you see some companies are just like not

1:59:11

trying sometimes you're trying you still fail it's but um like when they're doing the bond exchange when they're

1:59:18

trying to cut costs i mean a lot of them just say that but um that's why the insider buying is important because it's kind of like

1:59:24

you're making a statement and um you see this with camping world right uh um

1:59:29

what's his name there keeps on buying the shares like he's like making a statement he's like this i'm still buying this and so

1:59:34

you just want a management team who cares and it's kind of unusual to see such a

1:59:40

speculative energy play like this where the management is it's kind of trying to do something you know another one is io where he

1:59:46

which is la payer or whatever his name is he kind of looks like he's trying to do something there that's in the portfolio but small

1:59:53

um but all these these could be like 10 baggers if they work out and then if i mean if oil prices re-rate

1:59:59

higher like for whatever reason i'm just saying these are all going to be these are

2:00:05

going to keep running i mean if some people are forecasting higher oil prices actually it could happen i don't really know

2:00:10

it could also come back down so much uncertainty in this industry now it always has been but even more so now

2:00:18

all right swift and significant action allowed forum to significantly lower blah blah blah this week reform successfully closed the exchange offer

2:00:24

for our successfully closed the transaction extends our maturity to 2025 and maintains our current cash interest cost

2:00:29

what wow how they do that in addition new

2:00:35

notes preserve equity value for our current shareholders and provide a deleveraging opportunity for a partial mandatory conversion to equity

2:00:41

at a significant premium to the current stock price form now see that was that's the way to do it uh

2:00:46

i didn't pour i didn't look at the fine details of antero but didn't we see that it wasn't uh it was

2:00:52

like four dollars or something wow okay so those are the two things so

2:00:58

two things are they they're maintaining the cash interest costs and they extended the mature three things extended the maturity

2:01:04

somehow they're maintaining the cash interest costs how do you how could you possibly do that whatever debt whenever you issued it in the past you would have thought

2:01:10

certainly would have been higher right now use up just did this too they had 10 didn't they

2:01:17

cash interest cost why is it because they gave a kicker a convert a convertible kicker

2:01:22

and that's how that's probably how the convertibles right i mean mandatory

2:01:29

conversion they're convertibles so they said all right we'll get we'll have this convertible kick to it but we

2:01:34

want a lower interest rate right trade-offs but it's at a much higher price to the

2:01:40

current stock price i could have to look this up oh is this a buy is this a super

2:01:45

speculative buy i have so much energy exposure

2:02:00

the expiration expiration results of the previously you see that okay that's better

2:02:07

accordingly the minimum participation condition of n yeah they needed 95 percent and they pulled it off

2:02:13

the hangar principle model through nani supes wow i did so they did this they did this

2:02:19

in june didn't they in the the first numbers they released they weren't close

2:02:25

yeah no it was even earlier than that wasn't it

2:02:32

this all happened in july oh management changes man i could have

2:02:38

sworn it was i'll guess it yeah no there it is oh was there a new what's going on here

2:02:46

is there something different

2:02:52

wait a second that's the main one that i remember what the hell

2:02:58

there was a dutch auction for its 6.25 senior notes due 2021.

2:03:04

okay the offer expired

2:03:13

that's the expiration date fifteen percent were validly tender and not valid what time pursuant to this is the company has accepted payment okay so

2:03:19

they only those so i remember this one because that would have been big because they were gonna they were buying back at a huge

2:03:26

look at this so the um um they were trying to buy back how much was it i can't remember how much it was

2:03:36

what's the total i forget what the total um they were talking about back by a ton of debt right but they were trying

2:03:42

to buy it back at a discount like a huge discount and i'm like can they pull this off where's the 2021 right there

2:03:49

this must have been that oh is this it i s maybe that's it look at the rate of

2:03:55

d or something look at that oh is it the real price look at this yeah

2:04:04

whoa that bond action what the hell see what i mean okay it just it just went up okay so this latest news

2:04:11

is really bullish on the for the debt holders look at that um i mean is that what they

2:04:22

just oh sorry i wanted to see the dollar

2:04:29

amount how much was this 400 original offers was 400 they were buying back 80

2:04:34

80 million worth but at like a super discounted price i'm like that's immediately that's a huge value

2:04:39

add this is how i did you talk about this with gamestop they couldn't buy back it what are gamestop price is that i mean

2:04:45

if you can wipe out debt at 40 cents on the dollar i think that's what they were trying to offer it was a dutch auction they were paying up to 40 cents i'm like this is

2:04:52

incredible if they can pull this off you just wipe out 60 cents on the dollar on the dead i'm like that's why not many

2:04:57

people agreed to that we got to keep going game sas prices are rising um

2:05:03

okay so so that was this exchange was achieved in combination 100 support okay so i remember this news

2:05:08

and i think no no this was the this was the new news sorry this one and this was the end of it

2:05:15

right based on a report provided by the agent with respect to the offer for the notes it was four hundred dollars

2:05:21

okay and that was the end of this one so they only bought we only got 50 then what the hell did they do

2:05:30

this is a different offer okay management changes i kind of i kind

2:05:35

of got left out then it's part of his continuing relationship we gotta look into this i have to look into this because this is um

2:05:42

this is five bagger material announce that as part of the its continuing cost reduction plan damn again

2:05:48

do sideline tiara huh see we didn't see we're looking at an insider by cadutia damn uh change the execution team who is

2:05:54

it um we'll be the he's gonna be the new evp evp

2:06:00

report to go what about the people who are leaving pablo mercado the cfo's resigning

2:06:08

yikes whatever okay okay then what happened commencement of

2:06:15

exchange offer where's that ah this can be real bullish you see

2:06:21

those bond prices huh those weren't joking around

2:06:26

are those the same notes are these the same notes

2:06:33

they're the same notes oh for new okay so first they did the dutch

2:06:39

first they did the auction i mean did they need to disclose that they were going to do this you know what i mean

2:06:45

yes not i don't know okay so now they're gonna this is they're doing a uh exchange just like

2:06:51

amsterdam did we say announce the commencement offer to exchange is existing notes for new nine percent convertible notes okay so that's what i mean so they say

2:06:57

the same cash costs the previous notes were six point two five percent these notes are numbers that's what i mean like there's no way whatever we'll get

2:07:04

through maybe there's some nuance here that makes it possible but there's no way you issue debt in this environment

2:07:09

at a lower interest rate than you did whenever the hell you're interested in the past there's just no damn way okay but maybe

2:07:14

that but with the convertibles and stuff right uh the new notes will pay interest at the rate of nine percent blah blah blah and

2:07:20

so such a choice six point two five will be payable in cash in two and a half percent will be paying but available in cash or additional

2:07:27

notes at the company's option what the hell the new notes will mature so this is probably quite common in the uh

2:07:34

in the bond world but uh this this isn't my expertise to be totally honest um the new note will mature five years

2:07:42

from issuance as compared to the maturity on october 1st 20th 21st okay all right so they've

2:07:48

just got they bumped it up five years which is sick now this is just in uh an exchange offer okay secured by

2:07:54

firstly you know substantially all the companies assets except for revolving credit facility which will secure the new notes on a second lane basis

2:08:02

the notes will also be convertible into common stock as described in more detail below investors will participate in the exchange receive one thousand

2:08:09

dollar principal amount of new notes for each one thousand dollar principal of the existing notes the tenders are submitted by five pm

2:08:15

yeah holders who submit by five i have a pro

2:08:22

rata of a total payment of through

2:08:32

not be able to receive any cash and we'll only wait holders who tender what we're sorry what's going on here

2:08:37

potentially this change will receive a thousand principles of new notes for each one thousand got it provided that the tenders are

2:08:42

submitted by yeah got it in addition holders who submit tennis by 5 pm on july 17th will receive a pro

2:08:47

rata portion of a total payment of 3.5 what they're literally paying cash

2:08:55

is this a thing they're saying a few tender new tender will give you money

2:09:01

i haven't seen that before yo what the hell

2:09:09

so when gamestop was doing and i assume this is how many people do it is that they say if you do it by this state we'll get we'll pay

2:09:15

you a larger which is this is somewhat similar right we'll pay you a larger percentage of par

2:09:20

um or whatever it is whatever the dollar amount and then if you wait then we won't pay you as much but an outright payment of cash is that

2:09:26

a thing but they're just like they're like all right instead of said three and a half million and then uh if you give us money

2:09:31

we'll give you some of this you know what i mean it seems kind of odd but it for all i know it's super common holders who tender after july 7 will not

2:09:37

be able to receive cash any cash fee will only receive 950 of new notes okay so then there's also

2:09:43

this discount too um all right so maybe they said okay

2:09:50

so then you have to take a haircut so that's what i mean okay so the haircuts here then the nine here the 950 per 1000 but they also get

2:09:58

the the percentage of cash holders who precipitate the exchange i've also been given their consensus to eliminate certain restrictive cousins

2:10:03

covenants and evidence events of default in the existing notes gamestop two same things like this is huge because

2:10:10

i mean you need a legal team to pour over the fine details of those covenants and the

2:10:17

restrictive covenants and events of default and stuff because you need the indenture and stuff and for an individual investor it gets difficult to track all these things but

2:10:24

a good rule of thumb is that management has to finger on the pulse of stuff they need to get off the books like gamestop i'm like they know what they need what

2:10:29

covenants they need to get rid of to accomplish their goals um and so does this team as well

2:10:36

and so whenever you see this if you see that they successfully got rid of certain covenants that's bullish

2:10:41

some of the things that matter too but that's bullsh change will expire crude exchange offers conditioned on

2:10:46

minimum particularly at least 95 percent so i may have seen this i remember thinking oh they're not gonna get

2:10:52

although in gamestop pulled it up too they needed 50 for theirs and they got 52 percent like holy that was close um

2:11:00

unless the minimum condition is satisfied or wave the company will not be obligated to consummate the exchange

2:11:05

holders of approximately 217 million principle about their 64 percent

2:11:12

okay so they don't look it looks like they already spoke to people in 66 they already had 60 at least verbally

2:11:18

agreed said that okay i'll do this okay so they had some insight as to who was gonna

2:11:23

who's gonna agree which i assume gamestop did as well where they're like all right we talked to some folk the fact that they got 52 percent

2:11:29

instead of just about 50 i assumed that they had spoken to some people and probably the investors were on the dead too but like

2:11:34

they may have they may have executed that very well i'm not sure but in this case this was smart right

2:11:40

you got to talk to the bond holders and be like this is what we're going to do you're going to agree to this and they had 66 support but they still had to get

2:11:45

to 95. any existing notes that remain outstanding after closing exchange will be effectively subordinated to the new

2:11:51

notes so another incentive to uh to make the exchange i mean they're wow they're kind of

2:11:58

you're kind of bullying the bondholders a bit aren't you interesting that they are i wish i i

2:12:03

wish i had a better a grip on this stuff covenants for the existence will be eliminated upon the receipt wow

2:12:08

a portion of the new notes equal to 150 million total principal amount 46 percent of the notes will be mandatory it will be mandatorily convertible into

2:12:15

common stock i assume it's at the company's discretion on a pro-rated base at a conversion price of 135 to the goodies at the average daily trading

2:12:21

price for the pre-okay okay okay so now we know the dollar amount talking 135 150

2:12:27

that is that is quite the premium as opposed to entero we just looked at nintendo this is perfect it was like a the premium was like where

2:12:34

the stock price was trading the other day investors in the new notes will also

2:12:39

have the optional conversion rates in the um okay um

2:12:45

the new notes into more than 20 percent like

2:12:52

into more than twenty a failure to approve such research okay wait a second so the new notes will have

2:12:58

an optional conversion rights in the event that the company elects to redeem the new notes in cash and at the final maturity of the no

2:13:08

okay right so saying right for the converter okay okay okay so that so that was the

2:13:13

that was the commencement of it and now we kind of know that they pulled this up now it's expert in results uh the offer expired

2:13:20

and uh they got 96 percent wow we extremely pleased with the positive outcome this trans

2:13:26

conversion our original notes into notes had to meaningfully deleverage the balance sheet six changes in combination with that yep

2:13:31

abl lenders they were on board with all this ample liquidity ample liquidity okay if

2:13:37

you say so but i want to thank all our stakeholders i'm

2:13:42

also very pleased oh this is bullish huh uh i'm glad we

2:13:48

looked at this i that was confusing huh because that may stuff this is the thing if you're not if you don't remain dialed in on a company

2:13:54

i should have been following this still so closely given what's what was happening

2:14:01

and what's the latest what's the latest oh this was the preliminary rails i jumped ahead

2:14:06

all right so they pulled it off they pulled it off and then do we have the fundamentals up let's see this i mean it's not going to be reflected in

2:14:12

the in the numbers just yet super don't don't get there i mean this is speculative but okay so now we see

2:14:19

look at book value buck 69 on book value that's the thing with the company like this i want to be buying at uh

2:14:24

i want to be buying a 10 a book though 20 a book to be honest but you know what else would caught my

2:14:30

attention with um forum is the revenue they had a billion in revenues that's what i mean i thought this was like a super dodgy company

2:14:36

just just because of the the just because of what industries are in

2:14:42

uh the nature of their business and stuff not because of any accounting shenanigans or anything like that anyway about like a billion in revenues that's

2:14:48

no joke um and um

2:14:53

what do they still have they still have good what the hell's on the books that's it's intangible how is intangible how does this company still have intangibles

2:14:59

on the book i got to see this what are you kidding me

2:15:04

how do you still got goodwill in the books i just need to see this real quick you never is it goodwill or some other

2:15:13

like customer lists or something you ever see that what the hell is this there we go

2:15:20

what do you got intangible assets what is this

2:15:26

i'm not going to go dig the 250 intangible assets net what oh i don't care whatever

2:15:31

i'm assuming they're gonna get written down though i'll tell you that right now give me a break in tangible assets in

2:15:36

this industry um no way i just can't believe they haven't had to write them down so far

2:15:43

you know there's been plenty of write downs this whole time right you see when when you see a big huge drop in book

2:15:48

value but the cash operating cash flows and cash flow was positive and stuff you know that something was go something was going on

2:15:54

a huge negative ebitda though common eps huge i mean major losses but that bond

2:15:59

exchange is big that's what i mean if they successfully completed the bond exchange and if management cares like if they're

2:16:06

real if they're trying and they're like we're going to do this we're going to do this that might be enough and then we

2:16:12

traded a discount to book value not as much of a discount as i would like because this is risky this is a this is

2:16:18

this can't be a top 10 position or anything like that but the upside

2:16:25

the upside look at the operating cash flow too so here we go check out this operating cash flow

2:16:30

so we got 55 cents on the past 12 months 50 50 cent share

2:16:36

price what and simple free cash flow too

2:16:42

50 cents see that i need to hide the highlighter besides that thing

2:16:49

oh is that legit wow that's what i mean it's

2:16:57

okay this might be an ad how big is it in the portfolio uh energy more energy

2:17:03

uh this is this is what i mean where i'm calling on energy right but it's like a business specific thing that's going on

2:17:08

here this bond exchange is like uh unique to this and you saw how the bonds reacted you know what i

2:17:14

mean because that's because they um these were the ones that got exchanged right that's part of the

2:17:20

reason did they get the new one no the new ones aren't there yet no price on the new ones yet it just happened

2:17:26

ah what do you think

2:17:34

all right i guess i could add to this wow wow i can't believe they pulled that off

2:17:41

they needed 95 percent of the gun 96 i mean they were kind of you kind of had what was your what are your alternatives

2:17:47

you know what i mean if you're the bondholder what was the alternative again today i

2:17:54

mean if they tender after they were going to get a discounted a discounted haircut

2:18:01

and if they didn't they were just going to be subordinated they were going to be smarter you know what i mean is that so is that in the original

2:18:06

indenture that someone they can just release new i guess yeah it's it comes down to

2:18:12

the quality of that original indention you know what i mean if it was like lower quality i mean this isn't the right phrasing but if you

2:18:18

get some outs if you're the management team um you can just you could just body you

2:18:23

can just body the bondholders into into the exchange in into an exchange

2:18:29

where you just get rid of the covenants too it's kind of surprising to me but i don't know enough about it i i should i uh with more time i i'd

2:18:36

like to know more about it but um i don't know so far the rules of thumbs the rules of thumb have been helpful for

2:18:41

me like i don't even though i have not poured over the the dentures here or the the nuances and all that

2:18:47

stuff i still get the gist of like this is bullish and this is a good thing and i feel like many times that's all you need for some of these things you

2:18:52

know what i mean look how simple this is kind of silly this is the extent of the analysis and then

2:18:58

i guess the only other thing that i do is pull up that balance sheet and um did i i didn't x out of that did i let's

2:19:03

just take a peek at this balance sheet and just let's see what we're dealing with here forget the forget the intangibles that's

2:19:08

ridiculous um 100 million in cash that's legitimate i mean the market cap's 60 million

2:19:15

but it has debt right so this debt's not it's not going to be reflected the bond exchange and stuff but that's okay okay accounts

2:19:22

receivables inventories and what's the inventories this is their equipment and services so

2:19:28

those could be a haircut who knows prepaid expenses accrued revenue as long as it's a going concern

2:19:33

629 okay maybe i mean this this is a case where we

2:19:38

didn't do this with the game stuff because it's not going bankrupt i mean some people are saying that i don't oh i don't know what they're

2:19:44

thinking but um in this case you do you probably do want to use fire sale prices um just in case

2:19:49

protect your downside okay and then you get the operating lease assets so you get so six 630 in assets but let's just call

2:19:57

let's just call it well for the sake of what's on the balance sheet we'll call it 600.

2:20:06

call it 600 give me a 100 for the fixed assets forget the leases deferred

2:20:12

financing costs forget the financing costs other long-term assets give me 10 7 10 and what's your current portion

2:20:21

this is all changed now minus 70 minus 70 minus 4 minus 3. i could have just done current

2:20:28

liabilities but i was just deferred income taxes skip forget the leases

2:20:34

minus

2:20:42

okay wow how many shares are outstanding

2:20:56

111 and minus 412.

2:21:02

yeah i mean i'm get what they got what do they got 150 on the books or something like that what do you say it's but it might be closer to one if you're trying to be

2:21:08

really i don't know okay

2:21:14

i think i'm just gonna say add to it and then we gotta kind of follow the story follow the energy it's just gonna track energy i mean we do all the do this analysis right just

2:21:20

go whatever the hell oil prices do you know what i mean just know what's gonna drive it and if the the company if the industry bounces back this is a

2:21:26

five bagger i i i wish i could tell you that you need a lot more analysis to get to that but

2:21:32

really it's as simple as that as long as the story is unfolding and as long as the story's not falling apart in this in this type of industry

2:21:37

and fundamental events are unfolding positively then it's just a matter of like get the

2:21:43

exposure to energy and then if it turns around it it could rise but it's just so speculative it's hard to

2:21:49

even if we spend more time we could spend two three four hours looking at this and it's really hard to get much significantly more conviction in this

2:21:56

um just because you see how vulnerable volatile the business model is and but the operating cash flow i really

2:22:01

like this positive operating cash flow positive simple free cash flow even in this environment what the hell

2:22:08

what the hell okay just quickly the cash flow statement quickly quickly

2:22:14

okay cash flow right you see this loss but you see that bigger that was six months ago right

2:22:19

this is gonna be a mess because it's only six months you need the other six months look at how low look at 1.5 million in

2:22:26

capex that's no joke what and it was covered by it was covered by asset sales nice job

2:22:32

management look at that this is what has my attention capex

2:22:38

for six months mind you all that was going on they only spent 1.6 million and they sold assets to kind of cover

2:22:43

that and they only burned uh 200 000 1000

2:22:50

that's what i mean management teams it looks like they're trying it looks like they're trying

2:22:55

okay add to it done gotta keep moving oh we're so off script today look what you did look what you did

2:23:02

how did we come across this we came across it because of insider bond that's going to be the death here see the tangents to go down but you see

2:23:09

what i mean it doesn't mean looking at the daily movers look at an insider behind and um oh xerox i never did add xerox go to

2:23:16

call like on but then you go down these paths to follow up on stuff so maybe you just did this just because

2:23:22

you know what i mean maybe he was just making a statement it's still it's so small but still he was almost just like all right let me just show you that i'm

2:23:27

still going to buy some shares i'll tell you what if they bought more if they did another huge purchase super bullish

2:23:34

i'd be bullish even more bullish all right did i say add i don't have to fet maybe i'll get it to i don't know i can

2:23:41

let me sleep on it baby baby let me sleep on i never did buy xerox okay

2:23:48

what do you think i i didn't even get on the i said i was going to get in the portfolio just like

2:23:54

cdnt i i don't have an excuse why i didn't i think i was just waiting i'm not

2:23:59

really waiting for anything he's been buying a ton of it though

2:24:08

this might be enough to get it in the portfolio remember i didn't think it was super cheap that was the thing that was that's the thing i'm trying to

2:24:14

raise i'm trying to like raise some cash here so i don't just want to put it in there like i'm not looking i don't need more

2:24:20

exposure to yeah i'm not going to add it i know i made that note but we'll keep moving

2:24:27

i think that was just about it oh yeah what's this one doing

2:24:32

boy i own this in the past etm it's communications type uh the

2:24:40

family controls this company the fields um but super leveraged that child looks

2:24:47

like uh i i uh might have got a gain on it i i probably

2:24:53

owned and i sold out in march i didn't like it i didn't like the i don't like the risk

2:24:59

with everything that was going on you know i mean like everything else the compelling like who the hell needs this and that's saying something too because

2:25:05

150 200 positions or whatever the hell it was if if i cut you i mean i cut some of the wrong ones right but uh all right i

2:25:10

think that's it for this okay um and then what's his name this guy keeps on buying every day look

2:25:17

at this he's talking about statement oh who just sold the c-o-o yeah that's okay every day

2:25:23

100k 100k 100k you know he's making a statement that i like that's why i used him as an example because look at this

2:25:29

every day maybe he knew um maybe tomorrow tamara told him she was

2:25:35

going to sell i wonder if i mean that's the ceo so maybe they're talking she's like hey heads up i'm gonna sell um and he was just like all right i'm

2:25:41

just gonna buy i don't know just it's kind of weird let's see if he keeps on buying after this

2:25:47

why don't you just do it on one purchase what's up with that i don't know all right i think that's it i'll caught

2:25:54

up on that and then um and then uh if you remember this one this is just do

2:25:59

you see what some activists are doing so carl shows up here too for xerox um

2:26:04

this was a mess too because it was quarter end but i thought i saw something you could see this okay right

2:26:12

um i thought i saw something oh that was his filing dkl what the hell

2:26:17

did i see oh asps here you go again they bought

2:26:22

were they buying more they did they increase um

2:26:28

yeah that's bullish the asps was that one that just got whacked and i was like oh i messed that up because i held

2:26:34

on too long oh this is good okay so i never sold but i didn't add either but do what should i add to this now now

2:26:40

i'm wondering if i should add that they didn't it didn't phase them

2:26:47

wait didn't we just dare park did they actually let's just make sure it's it's it's 27 i don't even know who

2:26:52

they are though so let's we got to google them real quick ah it looks like a hedge fund

2:27:00

not gonna differentiate yourself from other alternative investment firms applying fundamental credit analysis and

2:27:07

balance with proper risk management hey slow down

2:27:13

focus on opportunities throughout the entire credit spectrum all right so credit specialists

2:27:18

ah deep value fundamental approach i don't know that's i don't know but they say deep value right in their

2:27:24

deep value discipline they're on the right path uh but i don't have no experience that's the thing

2:27:30

when you track people over time you start to in firms you start to get a feel for whether or not they deal in in good potential stocks i

2:27:37

have no feel for this this company this isn't enough to just see deep value like oh they know what they're doing it's

2:27:42

because with many of the funds that i track and stuff i know they've had a history of success because i usually maybe i've invested alongside them and

2:27:48

i'll oh they got in that one just like i did just like um with clifford sosan on those two companies now i'm gonna have

2:27:54

much more i didn't really know him much more respect for him now that he's pulled off those 10 baggers um so i

2:28:00

don't know this from either but um well it said 24 percent of their portfolio but that's because they don't

2:28:06

have to file of what we know about them oh yeah they dealt in this one too aria res i i think that's in the portfolio too

2:28:16

they nailed it too they were buying like right here watch this

2:28:23

may i saw these may purchases oh they didn't nail it

2:28:29

oh they were buying right up into earnings they were buying a mark that's what got my attention they were buying in march at twelve

2:28:35

dollars again i don't know these ferns but it's i'm just watching their behavior you know what i mean so they're buying

2:28:40

um a good chunk of chains millions of millions i mean millions of dollars worth here they are spending two million it's

2:28:46

only added three percent of the businesses they get a sizable stake right and they're buying this is what they're buying in the in the in the midst of it

2:28:52

all the craziness that's going on in march um they're buying this an asps

2:29:00

yeah this and asps that's what they're buying i'm like this is what you're buying and um and then it fell it fell it fell from

2:29:05

those prices wait what what's this date yeah they were buying like right here and

2:29:11

all this way down all this way up and then go and i'm like okay now i'll buy and so that's when i started buying right here right because

2:29:17

it was after this huge sell-off i've never heard of the company before um in fact should we should we

2:29:23

understand what they do do you know what they do uh let's see

2:29:30

um and it was a residential real estate but isn't there something quality affordable rental homes

2:29:35

exceptional variety suburban communities that have i thought there was something else to it

2:29:41

it's a single family housing um

2:29:46

i forget i thought there was something else to it something some other angle that um was it like um affordable rental homes

2:29:55

i don't know ah so they're buying more huh but it didn't look i didn't know what

2:30:01

the upside was i didn't think of the upside on enough but asps looked like it could have some upside

2:30:06

all right maybe i'll add to this all right i'll pull up the fundamentals

2:30:11

for that one because i think i made a note hey let's look at asps and i uh which one should i do this over

2:30:20

um yeah that got my that was what i was looking for when i just pulled that stuff up i saw that i said oh okay because

2:30:26

remember i said all right let's just see the chart look bearish and everything let's i'm like let's just pump the brakes let's just see what happens it's

2:30:31

going down and then it looks like it was it this week on friday it popped it came back up so i didn't trim i didn't add i didn't do anything

2:30:38

because i just thought i mean i i assume i assume i was on the

2:30:43

right track with the stock right unless i see some like if you miss earnings and you fall 20 that that's not as big a deal um

2:30:50

it's not that big a deal it's like that can happen so my assumption is that just my i'm working

2:30:55

under the assumption that i'm right about the stock right because whatever it was that caught my attention if i pulled the trigger on it then there

2:31:02

was something there and uh then i'm like all right let me just see what happens and then if the pressure unless the first piece was like super scary or

2:31:08

something then i'm like alright then i'd sell but still i wasn't super dialed into it that's why i'm like yeah i don't know

2:31:13

let's just wait um and i don't i didn't pour over the press

2:31:18

release which i guess was part of my reason for dragging my feet too but i'm telling you dragging my feet it helps me sometimes

2:31:24

sounds silly all right let me just pop up asp oh no oh because i wasn't supposed to type that there i

2:31:30

got to change this ass i gotta go over here to do this this is dumb i gotta put it in this tab this is silly 9 30. oh we're not

2:31:38

going to get through wrong kid that's okay we're doing good analysis right this counts this counts

2:31:47

that's it okay that's it for that one isps

2:31:52

uh asps they're doing like this it's a real estate angle actually

2:32:02

marketplace for real estate mortgage industries like online right provides property preservation and

2:32:08

inspection services including vendor management marketplace transaction management payment management yeah so

2:32:14

it's um just times of real estate and mortgage industries i think it was founded by remember auckland i think did we talk about that uh the

2:32:21

guy who founded aquin or something he's like related to it or are they

2:32:28

they're like like sister companies or something like one of them is has a good chunk of the revenues of the other and that's always a little bit of

2:32:34

a red flag a little bit of it's it's a red flag that's this would never be a huge

2:32:39

position for that reason but if the fundamentals look compelling enough i don't want to say i'd overlook it but

2:32:44

i know other people are discounting them for that reason and i might be like ah that's okay

2:32:49

well yeah that's a risk i'll take and uh and i'll defend against it otherwise how do you defend that's the things like some

2:32:55

people risk management what would they do they just won't even touch the stock they'll say out of my wheelhouse they keep moving or they'll say um i mean i guess that's

2:33:03

mostly it but what i'll do is i'm like i'll take the position and then maybe i um i keep

2:33:08

it small or i have a stop loss you know i mean you can do these other things too and in the context of the portfolio it can make

2:33:14

sense like that particular risk that um there's sister companies and maybe

2:33:19

there's some shenanigans going on there that's a risk that's very ice it's very specific to that company it's

2:33:25

it's it's it's uncorrelated with the other risks and the rest of the portfolio you know what i mean um so in that sense it kind of makes

2:33:32

sense it could make sense i should say all right this is asps what did i see in this i see the revenues declining like

2:33:37

whoa huh but uh and then i see negative tangible book value

2:33:42

um and i see a huge huge look at this earnings per share negative 22 per share

2:33:50

but opera i saw the operating cash flow look at that there's always something that i saw if i pulled the trigger you know what i mean so that's what the first thing i look for i see revenue's

2:33:56

growing but then now come falling off i see gross margin falling off yikes

2:34:02

i see uh book value collapsing i see positive ebitda though quite a bit of ebitda you know what i mean like

2:34:08

look at these historical earnings and oh they've been buying back shares look at this

2:34:13

they've gotten back 20 over the past couple years interesting for what appears to be a levered company

2:34:20

sometimes that's super risky right because they're maybe they're being like too they're being crazy but or sometimes

2:34:25

it's a really good thing like antero i kind of use the good thing that i'm buying back shares maybe i'm gonna feel bad i'm gonna feel like an idiot

2:34:31

for that but uh i don't know all right so look at this operating cash flow four buck five bucks per share

2:34:37

right or let's even look at simple free cash flow although this one's going to be weird free cash flow because of the nature of the business i bet their cash

2:34:42

flow statement looks a little bit weird it's a reit right or just real estate whatever whatever so

2:34:47

it says free cash flow like four bucks simple free cash flow here's that definition oh you can't see that

2:34:53

you really need i look at that so often i feel like i should um that's simple for cash flow um

2:35:00

but two times it trades at two times simple free cash flow even if it's messed up we'd have to look at the cash flow statement i can't make that

2:35:06

statement without looking at it but see what i mean like legitimate cash

2:35:12

legitimate cash ugh messy though i don't know but a history a long

2:35:19

history of positive operating casual look at even this year where it's getting crushed positive operating cash flow

2:35:26

positive operating cash flow it's a negative symbol free cash flow

2:35:32

dip negative net cash flow 250

2:35:38

wow and ev to ebitda what do i got 0.5

2:35:46

wow you know what i mean like that's really it's really cheap

2:35:51

like five is cheap you know what i mean that's a tenth of that market cap 154 that's small all right i

2:35:59

like this why do i like this i like this because deer park that fund i don't even know who they are their park road they say the expertise

2:36:06

is this type of a thing you know what i mean and it's safe to assume they're interacting with the management team and

2:36:12

getting the the low down is management buying

2:36:18

100k and oh i missed this hey how did we miss this august 12th 100k

2:36:25

from the chairman of the board ceo it's not that much how much do they own they bought 25k in november

2:36:35

all right let's take a peek at this def def

2:36:41

how much do they own do they own a good chunk i think i'm sold um

2:36:49

if they want a good chunk i'm sold oh that's the guy he yeah yeah so so he

2:36:55

oh i didn't i forgot he owned this much this is the guy who founded awkward isn't he

2:37:02

yeah there you go um one of the country's largest non-bank mortgage servicers after big banks re-rated all

2:37:08

right okay okay this guy still owns 40 and that's the thing i think they're do i think these companies are doing business with each

2:37:14

other or some but here's the thing so because i looked in i don't remember off the top of my head

2:37:20

watch this how about this related party transactions

2:37:25

oh we're in the wrong what is this no no

2:37:32

we're on the wrong one wait a second

2:37:41

what's that say oh i got thrown off because it wasn't the ticker of the other one arias what the hell

2:37:48

holy the ticker was this one resi and then i was looking at this one then it says from resi wait a second

2:37:56

is it the same company it's not is it what is arya it's not is it

2:38:08

ah i'm just trying to find out what that acronym is

2:38:14

oh there we go it is oh jeez these are related companies oh that was a

2:38:19

here i was thinking it was awkward it's these two damn companies and deer parks buying both

2:38:25

okay why is um okay

2:38:30

sale the remaining uh the sale of 0.7.5 million front yard residential corporate shares for net proceeds

2:38:38

as a result of the company repaid 45 million senior terminals from the sale of financial services and resid

2:38:44

why did it own shares in that oh does he own shares of rezzy

2:38:54

wow that was it huh and asp in uh and in deer park roads buying both huh interesting

2:39:04

the same dude owns all this what the hell

2:39:11

is this bullish some people might see this and they think that that's a red flag i think it might be bullish

2:39:19

deer park owns 12 percent of this and what do they own in the other one

2:39:28

twenty percent so william irby is kind of related to that okay but him not him individually isn't is not an

2:39:34

owner all right so there's that's i don't i

2:39:39

don't even care about digging in deep i'm supposed to right i'm supposed to care about i need to get to the bottom of what's going on here what exactly is

2:39:45

happening right that's how i'm supposed to react to this and i think whatever

2:39:51

i think all right i get it there's something going on here between the two i will have to dig into that um

2:39:56

down the line at some point i don't feel like doing it tonight but i do need i do want to better understand this relationship because you don't see this

2:40:02

too often you might see two companies with related party transactions and something going on going on who the hell is deer park road

2:40:08

getting involved with this you know what i mean they're stepping in they were like i see you own shares in this one

2:40:15

and i'm like i want to own both of you i don't see that too often and so this this is a story i'm

2:40:20

interested in learning more about um i guess even just for for educational reasons right but even if i'm taking the

2:40:26

position and you know what i mean um this is bullish though

2:40:33

i think i think i'm going to add to both i think i'm more intrigued by asps though

2:40:40

because they're they're they're um they're more services they're they're often they're providing a service to the industry and and resi

2:40:46

just looks more like a uh all right i mean i'll pull up rezzy but i remember thinking i don't i don't see much upside here

2:40:56

where's that nine because this one's top plus it's tough

2:41:02

to value wow why'd this one get lost whatever

2:41:09

all right i'm gonna add i'm gonna add to both if deer park good thing deer park road bot see what i mean if their park

2:41:14

road done by i wouldn't be doing this they're kind of making a statement too they already have a huge position this is only a three percent increase

2:41:20

how many shares 3.7 they've only been building building building building

2:41:27

and that's the thing so there's this risk right of this these deer park whatever the risk is deer park

2:41:32

is well aware what that is and if they're just a straight-up fund and kind of unrelated to the businesses

2:41:38

they're taking on the risk they don't give a they go yeah it's not as big as the markets pricing in um

2:41:43

without that without them buying in it and i saw holding each other's shares and stuff

2:41:49

like that i'd be like ah i don't know could be some funny business going on there still could be right i'm not saying it's not happening

2:41:55

but i just think it's a vote of confidence for this fund even more so if i was familiar with their with their style

2:42:02

that's okay i think i just don't oh everything broke no

2:42:10

oh all right so there's asps and where's uh

2:42:16

let's check out resi real quick so what stands out to me what i do need to just check out if i could just check out the uh just the cash flow statement

2:42:23

real quick uh let's look up last year last year just real quick just so i can

2:42:31

get a sense of what the hell a casual statement looks like for this type of a business losses right okay depreciation

2:42:37

amortization amortization blah blah blah goodwill right out yup

2:42:42

okay oh this looks big share based conversation 11 million

2:42:48

on what's operating cash flow wow that's big see this 11 million 12 million

2:42:57

12 million and 10 land uh so this that's being added back to

2:43:02

the cash flow statement right out to get to the operating cash flow but like that's a legitimate expense

2:43:08

you read about that and those you read about that when you're doing cash flow analysis right like uh and you see some tax benefits you can

2:43:15

kind of impute what the actual expense would be so in theory you'd kind of you'd kind of

2:43:21

reduce operating cash flow by this dollar amount so that's what the books say you know what i don't care um

2:43:30

um accounts receivable than the working capital so we'll just average this out

2:43:35

okay so i'm seeing 66 68 40 everything else looks fine just usual stuff working capital

2:43:40

management all down here short-term investments in real estate

2:43:46

they're all kind of flowing so i'd say 50 let's call 50.

2:43:51

okay so this is the thing so only this is counted as additions to only two million

2:44:00

holy that's legit this is like what we just saw with uh

2:44:06

forum where they only had like 1.5 million in capex or something like they only have 2 million in cap x and

2:44:12

they're generating 40 50 60 million in operating cash flow that's the low um i mean that's lo

2:44:19

that's a low cost to continue generating the cash flow assuming that uh

2:44:25

that's the thing are they under inve not in this case but when you're looking at this you get a separate maintenance capex and growth capex and his

2:44:31

maintenance capex actually adequate enough to like sustain the revenues moving forward you know what i mean

2:44:36

in this case i don't get like there's so much this is so messy that that's besides the point but in theory if you're doing cash flow analysis that's free

2:44:42

cash flow analysis that's what you have to do and try to parse out what maintenance capex is in this case this is

2:44:48

this is so big that's what that's probably what deer park i mean deer park knows much more about

2:44:53

this no it's like 99 more than i do about this but uh look at this 4 million 2 million even if

2:45:00

they're on even if they're not investing enough in the business even if it's five million ten million we're still looking at 30 million and weren't they buying back shares we

2:45:06

said damn it keep on them all over the place

2:45:13

yeah you're still looking at uh you're still looking at a buck two bucks three bucks in free cash flow

2:45:21

what the hell that's a low cap x requirement

2:45:28

and the proceeds from the sale business so they're selling businesses right so they're generating some cash this way proceeds from sale of equity securities

2:45:34

that's probably res i did that's how much they had eight million eight billion no

2:45:40

i was gonna say that's gotta be that's not in thousands geez see what i mean i get thrown off when i'm dealing in sizes i'm not used to

2:45:48

oh i like this i like this

2:45:53

i like that they're generating cash from the asset sales too you know what i mean i always like that

2:46:00

debt though leveraged leveraged related party stuff going on here that i still need to learn more about

2:46:06

all right and let me just say um um

2:46:27

ah i i phrased itself the wrong way sorry learn more about relationship with rezzy

2:46:34

but i don't think i'm gonna add to rezzy though because i just don't see i mean i'll pull it up but oh i pulled up the fundamentals

2:46:41

all right so i'm going to leave here so that's what i mean so this this cash flow like looks like it might be legitimate see what i mean this is so

2:46:47

big i was like all right something's it's something's above my head or it doesn't it doesn't calculate cleanly in my

2:46:54

spreadsheets because i'm so used to like materials and industrials and energy and consumer discretionary but when i step into the finance world it's a little bit

2:46:59

different and their financial statements a little bit different and um sometimes i just need to dig in and i'm

2:47:06

also less confident in my analysis of those types of things but that looks pretty straightforward to me

2:47:11

um and so this these multiples that we're seeing on the left hand side here too hold on let me let me flip flip flip

2:47:18

adelphia okay and then on the left-hand side though you see all this green this is legit evd to 0.5

2:47:26

earnings yield of of 80 percent 125 property cash this is cheap enough for

2:47:32

me you know what i mean these other risks i'll take on these risks i'll take on these risks for these uh for these numbers

2:47:38

and negative 10 to the book there's this hair on it make no mistake but um

2:47:45

right okay and then for for resi

2:47:51

i like this too because it's uh you see my reluctance with uh like phet right because i got all this energy exposure

2:47:56

right do i really need more in an added wrist like that this one at least is a little bit different a little

2:48:02

bit of a different type of risk it's real estate and um messy but i don't give a that's

2:48:08

what i do uh okay all right let me close out of some

2:48:13

here i get all this open i'm glad i'm glad this stream didn't slow down that's good i got final

2:48:19

cut open too i'll try to finish the uh i gotta i gotta do some editing on that i'm interrupting myself i only got 10

2:48:25

minutes left i'll do some finish up the editing on that gamestop video and hopefully i can have it

2:48:31

finished tomorrow that's the thing i know how i know what i have to do but once i get heading into it might take me a little bit longer so i'll do my best but i'll see

2:48:37

if i can get it out by tomorrow if not by tomorrow maybe by the end of this weekend or something but i'm close

2:48:43

i'm close and then uh and then at that point we'll just be waiting for more news in the company what the hell else

2:48:48

how much can you say about a damn company you know what i mean but i'm using gamestop as a template for doing videos about these other

2:48:54

companies you know um and so when i do let me know your thoughts on the video because if you like that style of video i try to pick

2:49:00

up some video editing techniques and then i can um then then it's good because i've just done a lot of the work and the educating myself on

2:49:07

final cut and how to do some of those things it's still taking a long ass time but uh moving forward it should be

2:49:12

streamlined you just got to put in that initial that initial growth cap x and then the maintenance capex is much less you see

2:49:19

what i mean see it all connecting all the dots you get that all right here's rezzy okay so six book six bucks intangible

2:49:27

book e with the two million there's something

2:49:33

ah there's something else about this company first of all what the hell do i see on these numbers i don't see

2:49:39

super leveraged but that's okay declining tangible book

2:49:45

and if you look at the chart too i mean i'm looking i am looking at the fundamentals but you see the chart you see the same i know you just had

2:49:51

this up where's it gonna go 15 bucks 12 bucks i mean it's

2:49:56

maybe it's a lo it's a low risk thing i don't know but this isn't usually my style play i like the asps

2:50:01

the i like the asps risks these ones

2:50:08

anyone talking about these

2:50:15

bearish really

2:50:20

oh i think i've seen his analysis and i don't know excuse me i don't know him too well

2:50:27

he's a single family residential reit oh a single right single family residential read i still thought this so

2:50:33

they i mean it's single family homes and stuff

2:50:40

okay so i can check that out oh here we go yeah and so and more recently frontier decided to end its existing asset management agreement with

2:50:46

lt source asset management pay a total 46 million to break the deal all right so i'll have to so he touches

2:50:52

on this that's good that's good so i can read more about that i'll let me flip back and then we just see if this stuff on amps i can check this later oh i'm going

2:50:58

to run low on time at least i finished with these two companies and we found a couple of good things that we found a bunch of things

2:51:04

today in the portfolio you know who needs to screen when you get this many stocks in the damn portfolio it's

2:51:10

all right there we don't even have time to get to get to other stuff

2:51:15

anything here no i don't see anything here all right but i got to read that other guys i i like reading the bearish articles because then

2:51:20

there could be some good counter arguments maybe they're gonna yeah i'll have to check that out

2:51:26

oh yeah i'll say that uh

2:51:33

nothing on asps though obviously that's the one i'm more curious about

2:51:40

okay okay okay okay okay now where were we oh uh oh that was okay

2:51:47

we got through inside about how about daily movers we got time for daily movers ah we so we didn't get through the morning kitty portfolio but we made good progress on a good number of

2:51:53

companies i have to say oh is this the one that i missed

2:51:59

don't show me this chart no that's okay i didn't miss it momenta

2:52:05

in a data isn't momenta that huge are they related to like some kovid drugs or something in a data well i've

2:52:12

only did no data before oh 46 it's done nothing though

2:52:18

not a missed opportunity i was getting involved right like a buck

2:52:23

or something that's a long that's a long double that's not the for the risk that you were taking on too

2:52:30

not worth it hudson cbl resolute rfp circ tailored forget about what is

2:52:35

this it's bankrupt 20 come on kirkland's missed opportunity don't get me started

2:52:41

um silver ball okay so silver ball is this up because of natural gas i think this can this is like an interesting natural gas play by the way

2:52:50

that could be a way to play it too i wish that was super speckled look this looks like a this looks like a mess

2:52:56

but um could check that out later

2:53:01

it's not a portfolio i get so much risk on that i i don't know if it's a risk i want really i got so much other we got

2:53:07

talking about ngs gonna add to that did i say b set had to be said as lower risk plan holes

2:53:12

potentially i'm still not totally sold on that target wow that's a big move for target

2:53:19

beasley pam beasley

2:53:27

radio stations radio stations interesting levered i wish the insiders were buying

2:53:33

oh it's in the portfolio is it still there oh you know what i think it's one of the smallest

2:53:38

non-nominal positions like i looked at it recently because i was looking through the smallest position i'm like should i just sell this and i'm like nah

2:53:44

just keep it i don't know that i'm gonna add to it i would need to see

2:53:50

something

2:53:57

i need to see something it's like level radio stations you know

2:54:02

someone taking a stake or something at home don't get me started yrcw

2:54:09

i'm less uh it's okay that i missed this one i still should have had it though should

2:54:14

have been in the portfolio the trucking remember i talked about trucking like why didn't i have why did i not have more trucking in the

2:54:20

portfolio i don't understand that this was one of the most speculative ones i would have added but it would have been like third or it

2:54:25

would have been like fourth on the list it was like three other ones i had trucking going into the crisis too

2:54:33

maybe a couple of them got stop lost out and then i just lost track because of so many damn positions but why rcw that was

2:54:38

one that uh it would have been my speculative tracking play i always just kind of liked the chart the chart looks

2:54:44

the truck always looked interesting one dollar to two dollars i like the chart hey we got through the daily so not many movers today that helped

2:54:51

tuesday oh yeah this company's bankrupt it just looks like it could be uh the time to get it was at 12 this was

2:54:56

the time right there it could be like a five bagger from those could even be it could be worth a buck check out the secant alpha which is

2:55:03

named bloom or blum he talked about that looks uh looks interesting looks like the so balance sheet looks

2:55:08

surprisingly strong for a bankrupt company um i'd have to check the update on that

2:55:14

in fact let me do that just quickly right now what is this real rarely do i would i want to dabble in a bank it's

2:55:19

not in the portfolio roaring kitty portfolio yeah boom there you go

2:55:24

rarely do i deal in bankrupt companies but uh he just he's good at credit analysis type stuff i respect his

2:55:30

we have somewhat similar styles not quite the same but i respect his analysis especially in a play like oh here he is

2:55:36

august 19. i agree it's an uphill battle to get an equity committee in any wait agrees it's an uphill battle to get an equity command

2:55:42

in any bankruptcy case but we have a better than normal case here

2:55:48

uh did it not work out oh i was hoping it worked out

2:55:53

yes inventory drive down was too oh i don't like that what's he is he trying to make a

2:56:00

equity committee no i'm done no i'm not doing no equity committee nope nope nope nope i thought they would be able to avoid that i was like it

2:56:06

looked like a surprisingly strong balance sheet for a company in bankruptcy all right four minutes we got four minutes come on

2:56:14

what the hell do i do i don't know what to do back to the portfolio do we have time to

2:56:19

do anything look at all these tabs i don't know were there any companies i didn't get to

2:56:25

i'm not gonna we already did the insider buying weekly movers that's the thing we kind of missed a

2:56:31

couple days we missed tuesday but um i don't have time for this tub

2:56:37

just kind of looking at the movers this is the thing this this should be like a friday thing you know i like looking at the weekly movers that should be like a

2:56:43

friday thing because that's going to capture tuesday and thursday too if assuming i even stick to this schedule

2:56:51

all right let me just get back to the morning kid i don't have time for this let me check the run key portfolio anything else that stands out let's

2:56:57

let's look at what a michael's ah damn it should have been a bigger position

2:57:03

this should be michael should be a one or one and a half percent right now that one's a that one's a missed opportunities i think i added that in

2:57:09

the list oh yeah we got this now sir [Music]

2:57:20

i thought we had we said that elsewhere but i forgot to add them into that list

2:57:26

tech crushing it sick ipi down six percent whatever until those insiders buying i o down so

2:57:32

this is another one of those speculative ones but it seems like the management team cares there but i'm not sure i want to see more insider buying or something

2:57:38

i got a position somewhere so phen i can't believe we're buying that i can't believe look what you look what you made me do look what you made me do

2:57:47

laurel i got some satellites and all right kind of a quiet day overall oh yeah this beasley up i'm cutting down

2:57:54

to the positions though what am i down to i'm down to 145. that's not bad it was

2:58:00

at like 185 when things were started so i'm to try like ads this is already a big winner

2:58:05

it's like a solid like low risk double i can kind of get that down xterran's a energy position like i

2:58:10

can probably get rid of some of these so be nice to raise some cash and redeploy it against some of these larger positions right um

2:58:21

yeah and we'll see and so uh i'll even buy some more gamestop you think i won't try me i'd like it's with now it's

2:58:27

mid-august we're just getting real close i might do one more i might do one more um

2:58:34

i might pull the trigger once more i might increase it another third i i don't know we'll see we'll see maybe i'll get a full night's

2:58:40

sleep and i'm like nah nah don't do that maybe just because i got some beers in me you know but uh

2:58:46

everything i mean most of the positions are working out right like reminding me that some of these are have been good picks and so the more i

2:58:52

think the more the more i think about keemstar the more i think i'm not wrong about it and uh the more i think i have to i should load up on this

2:58:59

position you know what i mean so maybe i'll do one more round i don't know we'll see let's see we'll see let's see what the

2:59:05

feedback i get i can get that video tomorrow get some feedback if people are like yeah yeah this is good and uh game stops going to the moon i don't

2:59:11

always go to the wood just kidding but um yeah still seems to be we haven't had any news in a while right

2:59:16

all summer like are they going to wait till earnings to release all their news they get the sale lease back they could be doing it plus uh i don't know so news will be

2:59:23

mid-september that's when the earnings read out would be like around september 10th or something maybe we'll get a bunch of a news dump

2:59:29

then but this is probably going to be a rough quarter this is like the last quarter that'll get all the news out and then i feel like it's going to be all

2:59:36

not all roses but all good news from here on out so we'll see i don't know anyway so let's raise some cash i'll make some decisions

2:59:42

and um and then we'll take it from there but yeah look at this all right so this is kind of a nice kind

2:59:48

of a nice we weren't i feel like we're always grinding right till 10 o'clock so cheers nice day nice time

2:59:56

3:00:02

3:00:08
